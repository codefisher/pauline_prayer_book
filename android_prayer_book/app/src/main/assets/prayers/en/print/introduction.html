<h1>Introduction</h1>

<div class="indent">
<p>
United with the Universal Church, we remain in the time of
preparation for the Great Jubilee of the Year 2000. In this prepara-
tion, we feel a need of personal conversion and renewal of spirit.
This desire becomes for us a unique invitation in this current year
of 1999 which is called in the Church the “Year of God the Fa-
ther.”
</p>
<p>
The yearning for our religious perfection is deeply linked
with love. Our Holy Father, Pope John Paul II, in speaking to us
Paulines, on the occasion of the 600th anniversary of Jasna Gora,
called us to be the “messengers of love, the servants of love.” In
order to achieve this, the Pope said: “to express that love, to serve
that love, you must continually strive to be filled with love.” We
attain that love only through prayer. In our Constitutions we read,
“It is in prayer that we are able to recognise the plan of God for us
and for the work. We are able likewise to enter more deeply into
the salvific mystery of Christ, thereby becoming joined with the
Father in the Holy Spirit in the work of continually renewing the
face of the earth. By this means we assist in the building up and
propagation of the Kingdom of God on earth.” (art.26)
Mary, the Mother of our Order, and St. Paul the First Her-
mit, our Patriarch, continue to encourage us in the contemplation of
God and perseverance in prayer.

I feel highly honoured that thanks to the dedicated labour of
my Confreres, this Pauline Prayer Book can be published. I trust,
that through this new edition, our whole Religious Community will
glorify God the Father with one Spirit and one heart.
