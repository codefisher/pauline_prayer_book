mounts guard over your people” (Dn 12: 1).</em>

O God, who arranges the services of Angels and men in a
wonderful order; mercifully grant that our life may be protected on
earth by those who always do your service in heaven. Through our
Lord, Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you, in the
unity of the Holy Spirit, One God, for ever and ever. Amen.
