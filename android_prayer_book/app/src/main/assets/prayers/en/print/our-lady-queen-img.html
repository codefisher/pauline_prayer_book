<em>“It is our conviction that in the course of some very turbu-
lent history associated with our Order (of which there is no lack),
the protection of Mary has been a support in striving for holiness
and making effective our mission to those peoples to whom Divine
Providence has sent us” (art. 60).

<p class="indent">
O, Lord, our God, may the intercession of the Most Holy
Virgin Mary protect us always, that freed from all dangers, we may
rejoice in your peace. Through Christ our Lord. Amen.
