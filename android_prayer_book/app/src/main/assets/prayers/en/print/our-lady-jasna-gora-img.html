<em>“Jasna Gora and other Marian sanctuaries, which play an
important role in the spiritual formation of people...constitute
something of great value. They endow our Order with a special
charisma, as well as a serious mission within our ministry” (Art.
62).

<p class="indent">
Grant, we beseech Thee, O Lord God, that we thy servants may enjoy perpetual health of mind and body, and by the glorious intercession of blessed Mary, ever Virgin, may we be freed from present sorrow, and rejoice in eternal happiness. Through Christ our Lord. Amen.
