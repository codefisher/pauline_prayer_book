<em>“Our fathers showed us how to live the Mystery of the
Cross as expressed in a life of willingly embraced difficulties and
mortifications. Thus they became more like Christ in suffering for
the sins of the world.” (art 34).

<p class="indent">
Almighty God, your Son, obedient to your Holy Will suf-
fered the agony of the Cross that all people may be saved. Grant
us, we pray that knowing the mystery of the Redemption of the
world, we may obtain its blessed fruits in heaven. Through Christ
our Lord. Amen.
