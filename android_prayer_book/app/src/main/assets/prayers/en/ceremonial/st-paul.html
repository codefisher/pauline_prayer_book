<h1>1. Novena</h1>

<p>
    NOTE: prayer book and ceremonial have half of this introduction in common. The common bit is below. Rest
    needs translation.
</p>

<p class="instruction">
    Traditionally, we begin the Novena 9 days before the external solemnity of St. Paul the First Hermit. It is before the next
    Sunday after the 15th of January. The novena to St. Paul the First
    Hermit enjoys a special splendour. It should take place in the
    chapel or at another place dedicated to St. Paul the First Hermit.
    All members of the community take part in the Novena. The solemnly professed Monks wear the processional mantle.

    Dear Brothers and Sisters,<br/>
    We have gathered in order to honour the Triune God who reveals to us the mystery of His Holiness
    in the life of St. Paul the First Hermit, Patriarch of the Pauline Order.
    The example of his heroic sanctity draws us all to the Father through Jesus Christ, and his
    merits an intercession obtain for us divine benefits.
    And so may the following hymn sung in honour of St. Paul, inspire us to a self-giving service of
    God.

<h1>2. Rite of the Blessing of Children</h1>

<p>
    MOST OF THIS IS MISSING NEEDS TRANSLATION
</p>

<h2>2.1 Introduction</h2>

<div class="prayer-group short-prayer">
    <div class="leader prayer"><div class="prayer-red short-prayer">V.</div>Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus
        Christ His Son, who showed His love to children, be with you all.
    </div><div class="prayer short-prayer"><div class="prayer-red short-prayer">R.</div>And with your spirit.
    </div></div>

<p>
    Lord Jesus Christ, when children were brought to you, you took them into your arms, and laid
    your hands on them, and blessed them, and said: &#8220;Suffer the little children to come to me,
    and forbid them not; for such is the kingdom of heaven; and their Angels stand before my
    Father and see Him face to face.&#8221; Through the intercession of St. Paul the First Hermit, let
    us pray for God&#8217;s blessing for these children, that he might surround them with his loving
    care.
</p>

<div class="prayer-group">
    <div class="prayer"><div class="prayer-red short-prayer">V.</div><strong>Let us pray:</strong>
        Loving God, though the meditation of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the Holy Guardian Angels and
        St. Paul the First Hermit, we ask you to send upon these children gathered here your
        Blessing, <span class="cross">&#9769;</span> may they constantly experience your loving care and
        protection. Through Christ our Lord.
    </div><div class="prayer short-prayer"><div class="prayer-red short-prayer">R.</div>Amen.</div></div>

<h2>2.2. The Liturgy of the Word</h2>

<div><div><div class="ref">10:13-16</div><span>A reading from the holy Gospel according to Mark</span></div></div><p>
    People were bringing little children to Jesus, for him to touch them. The disciples turned them
    away, but when Jesus saw this he was indignant and said to them, &#8216;Let the little children come
    to me; do not stop them; for it is to such as these that the kingdom of God belongs. I tell you
    solemnly, anyone who does not welcome the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter
    it.&#8217; Then he put his arms round them, laid his hands on them and gave them his blessing.
</p>

<div class="prayer-group">
    <div class="prayer"><div class="prayer-red short-prayer">V.</div>
        Lord, our God, out of the speech of little children you have fashioned a hymn of praise.
        Look with kindness on these children whom the faith of the Church commends to your tender
        care. Your Son, born of the Virgin Mary, gladly welcomed little children. He took them in
        his arms, blessed them, and held them up as an example for all. We pray through the
        intercession of Saint Paul the First Hermit that you, Father, will also send your blessing
        on them, so that they may grow in Christian maturity and, by the power of the Holy Spirit,
        become Christ's witnesses in the world, spreading and defending the faith. Through Christ
        our Lord.
    </div><div class="prayer short-prayer"><div class="prayer-red short-prayer">R.</div>Amen.</div></div>

<p>
    May the water, by which we will be sprinkled, remind us of our Baptism and our
    belonging to Jesus Christ, who has redeemed us by His death and Resurrection.
