        <span>(St. Anselm)</span></h2>

    <p>
        My God, grant me eloquence, the fullness of gentleness and wisdom that would not arouse me with an arrogance and superiority
        over others. I beg you to implant in my mouth the words of consolation, strength and encouragement. May I, through the power
        of the Holy Spirit inspire the good to be better, convert the wayward
        and, through my words and example, direct them on the path of
        righteousness. May the words you give to your servant be as hot as
        missiles and like fiery arrows that would penetrate and enkindle the
        souls of the listeners to a holy fear and love of you. Amen.

    </p>

    <h2 id="62-prayer-after-the-homily">6.2 Prayer after the homily</h2>

    <p>God the Holy Spirit, ignite our hearts and souls with the
        fire of your love that we may all serve you in submission and fidelity to your Word. May the efforts of my priestly service bring
        to me and to all my listeners and abundance of fruits. May their faith and
        hope be reflected in their daily living. For you live and reign as the
        Love of the Father and of the Son, one God for endless ages.
        Amen.
    </p>

    <h2 id="63-prayer-of-the-confessor-before-administering-the-sacrament-of-reconciliation">6.3 Prayer of the Confessor before administering the Sacrament of Reconciliation</h2>

    <p>
        God, Father of mercy, giver of all gifts and charisms, confer upon me the gift of your wisdom, responsibility and unique
        discretion to know the spiritual needs of the penitents that I may, as
        their confessor, help them in their process of conversion of life.
        Grant me the grace to discern accurately the true state of their consciences, that I may form them in truth and in the spirit of the Gospel.
    </p>

    <p>
        God, Father of compassion, give me the grace to be always a helpful servant to penitents, in their difficult process of conversion; to lift them up from an even worse downfall. Give me the
        grace to sincerely sympathise with them over their offence to God
        and ignorance of His love. As a minister of your mysteries, may I
        communicate your merciful love that leads man, overburdened
        with guilt, to reconciliation with you and with the Church, which,
        through the sins of the faithful, sustains many wounds and injustices.
    </p>

    <p>
        Lord, Jesus Christ you came into the world to seek out and
        save those who were lost, to call to repentance the sinner, to heal
        the broken-hearted. You desire not the death of the sinner, but
        await his conversion. Give me the grace to know for certain, that
        your love is stronger and greater than all our sins. May my intention to administer this sacrament be always pure and clear, that
        God may be honoured in everything and penitents be sanctified,
        spiritually liberated and healed. May my priestly zeal be prudent,
        my love pure and selfless, because I am administering this sacrament in Your Name, on your behalf, when I become somehow one with you, Jesus Christ, the Eternal Priest. Lord Jesus
        Christ, grant me the grace to be fully aware of your presence and
        your saving work. Make me merciful, kind and wise in asking
        questions, in carrying out pastoral dialogues, cautious and foreseeing in giving spiritual advice, in imposing the sacramental penance,
        in encouraging and strengthening the realisation of ones vocation
        in life.
    </p>

    <p>
        O Lord, you have sent the Holy Spirit on your Apostles to
        forgive sins and through the breath of this same Holy Spirit you
        have bestowed the power to loose and to bind. May this Holy
        Spirit, through his power, make my ministry successful and fruitful. Be with me, O Holy Spirit, especially in difficult situations
        and cases, that in showing understanding and compassion to penitents, I may never depart from the sound teaching of the Church.
    </p>

    <p>
        Strengthen me O Lord, one God in the unity of the Most
        Holy Trinity, with your spiritual strength, that in helping others, I
        myself may not be rejected.<br/>
        Mother of Mercy, pray for us!

    <h2 id="64-prayer-of-the-confessor-after-administering-the-sacrament-of-reconciliation">6.4 Prayer of the Confessor after administering the Sacrament
        of Reconciliation</h2>

    <p>O Lord Jesus Christ, our Redeemer and Conqueror of sin,
        I thank you that you have become the sacrifice of forgiveness for
        our sins and the sins of the whole world. In your wounds, lay our
        healing! You did not spare your Precious Blood to deliver us from
        the misery of our sins. Give me, and all my penitents, the grace to
        participate fully in your victory over sin that we may die to sin that
        thus it may never rule over us; and that we may live in your grace
        and grow in newness of life. I entrust to your infinite mercy, all
        my penitents that they may keep their good resolutions, on the road
        of new life. Surround with your merciful love especially those who
        for some reason, did not receive the sacrament of absolution, that
        they may not carry grudges against anybody, but come to you in
        due time, according to your Holy Will.
    </p>

    <p>
        O Lord of clemency, through your all powerful grace,
        make up for all my deficiencies, limitations, human weaknesses,
        errors, unawareness and shortcomings, committed while administering the sacrament of mercy. Be merciful to me!
    </p>

    <p>
        O Lord Jesus Christ, always rich in your mercy, you
        change the unjust into just, to the depressed you offer the hope and
        joy of a new life. Grant us the grace, we pray, that we may never
        waste the gifts received from you. As we, experience
        your merciful love, may we, too, be witnesses of this love toward
        others. <br/>
        Mary, Refuge of sinners, pray for us!
    </p>

    <h2 id="65-prayer-before-study">6.5 Prayer before study</h2>

    <p>O Lord, our Almighty God, you are the source of light and
        wisdom, pour into my will, my memory and all my faculties the
        grace of your blessing. Give me sharpness of mind to understand,
        a ability to remember, an ability to learn, a skill to interpret and an
        abundant grace of eloquence. Shed your light at the beginning of
        my study, direct its progress and bring it to a fulfilling outcome.
        For you live and reign for ever and ever. Amen.
    </p>

    <h2 id="66-prayer-after-study">6.6 Prayer after study</h2>

    <p>
        I thank you, Lord God for light and help in the efforts of
        my memory and mind. Give me the grace to use this knowledge
        for your glory, for my service to the Church of Christ, for the benefit of my Order and for the instruction of souls. Let the flame of
        my knowledge contribute to knowing you better and loving you
        more. For you alone are one God in the unity of the Most Holy
        Trinity. Amen.
    </p>

    <h2 id="67-prayer-for-the-sanctification-of-labour-st-pius-x">6.7 Prayer for the Sanctification of Labour <span>St. Pius X</span></h2>

    <p>
        Glorious St. Joseph, model of all who are devoted to labor, obtain for me the grace to work
        in the spirit of penance in expiation of my many sins; to work conscientiously by placing
        love of duty above my inclinations; to gratefully and joyously deem it an honor to employ
        and to develop by labor the gifts I have received from God, to work methodically,
        peacefully, and in moderation and patience, without ever shrinking from it through weariness
        or difficulty to work; above all, with purity of intention and unselfishness, having
        unceasingly before my eyes death and the account I have to render of time lost, talents
        unused, good not done, and vain complacency in success, so baneful to the work of God. All
        for Jesus, all for Mary, all to imitate thee, O patriarch St. Joseph! This shall be my motto
        for life and eternity. Amen.
