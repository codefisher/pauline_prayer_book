<h1>3. Second Meditation</h1>

<p class="instruction">
    At the appropriate time, according to <a href="constitutions/life-community-in-god.html#art28" ebook="ebook">art. 28</a>, a second
    meditation should occur which can be substituted by another form
    of prayer or devotion. Before and after the meditation some
    suitable prayer should be said, for example:
</p>

<p class="instruction">
    Before meditation:
</p>

<div class="prayer-group">
    <div class="leader prayer short-prayer"><div class="prayer-red short-prayer">L.</div>My Lord and my God!</div><div class="prayer"><div class="prayer-red short-prayer">All</div><p>I strongly believe that you are present here and that
        your eyes are turned upon me. I fall on my knees
        knowing that I am unworthy to stand before your
        Face but full of confidence in your infinite goodness,
        I humbly implore your grace that I may make this
        meditation for your greater glory and my spiritual
        benefit.</p><p>
        Illuminate my mind, move my heart, strengthen my
        will, that I may know you better, love you more and
        serve you more faithfully. I beseech this through the
        intercession of the Virgin Mary, St. Paul &#8211; the Father
        of our Order &#8211; and my Guardian Angel. Amen.</p>
    </div></div>

<div class="prayer-group short-prayer">
    <div class="leader prayer short-prayer"><div class="prayer-red short-prayer">L.</div>Queen of Hermits,</div><div class="prayer short-prayer"><div class="prayer-red short-prayer">All</div>Pray for us.</div><div class="leader prayer short-prayer"><div class="prayer-red short-prayer">L.</div>Mother of our Order,
    </div><div class="prayer short-prayer"><div class="prayer-red short-prayer">All</div>Pray for us.
    </div></div>

<p class="instruction">After meditation:</p>

<div class="prayer-group">
    <div class="leader prayer short-prayer"><div class="prayer-red short-prayer">L.</div>O God,</div><div class="prayer"><div class="prayer-red short-prayer">All</div>I thank you for the light and graces granted me during
        this meditation. I resolve to remain attentive to your
        will and to grow in your love. Renew me that I may
        be more aware of your voice and ready to assist my
        neighbours in their need. O Mary, into your hands I
        entrust my petition for the grace of perseverance in my
        resolutions and in love. Amen.
