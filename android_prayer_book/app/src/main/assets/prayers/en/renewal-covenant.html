<h1>14. Renewal of the Covenant with Mary the Mother and Protectress
    of the Order
    <span class="rubric">(16<sup>th</sup> January)</span></h1>

<p class="instruction">
    &#8220;On the feast of the Queen of Hermits, Mother and Protectress of the Order, observed on January 16th, each Community
    will renew its consecration to Mary. As part of the consecration,
    we offer first thanks, we then place ourselves totally at her disposal
    in our future action for the good of the Church and we beg her
    protection for ourselves.&#8221; (<a href="constitutions/our-lady-life-order-norms.html#norm66" ebook="ebook">Norm 66a</a>).
</p>

<p class="instruction">
    During the Conventual Mass presided over by the Prior,
    after the homily the principal celebrant, joined by all the members
    of the Monastery on their knees, recite the following prayer:
</p>

    on your feast day of the &#8220;Queen of Hermits&#8221;, we desire to renew
    our covenant of love with you. Above all, accept our grateful
