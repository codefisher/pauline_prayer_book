    He was beloved by God and man,
    whose, whose memory is blessed.
    He made him equal in glory to the holy ones,
    and made him great in the fears of his enemies.
    By his words he caused signs to cease;
    the Lord[b] glorified him in the presence of kings.
    He gave him commands for his people,
    and showed him part of his glory.
    He sanctified him through faithfulness and meekness;
    he chose him out of all mankind.
    He made him hear his voice,
    and led him into the thick darkness,
    and gave him the commandments face to face,
    the law of life and knowledge.

    At this time: Jesus said to his disciples: Let your loins be girded and your lamps burning,
    and be like men who are waiting for their master to come home from the marriage feast, so
    that they may open to him at once when he comes and knocks. Blessed are those servants whom
    the master finds awake when he comes; truly, I say to you, he will gird himself and have them
    sit at table, and he will come and serve them. If he comes in the second watch, or in the
    third, and finds them so, blessed are those servants! But know this, that if the householder
    had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would have been awake and[a] would not have left
    his house to be broken into. You also must be ready; for the Son of man is coming at an hour
    you do not expect.
