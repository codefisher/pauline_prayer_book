    When a righteous man fled from his brother&#8217;s wrath,
    she guided him on straight paths;
    she showed him the kingdom of God,
    and gave him knowledge of angels;[e]
    she prospered him in his labors,
    and increased the fruit of his toil.
    When his oppressors were covetous,
    she stood by him and made him rich.
    She protected him from his enemies,
    and kept him safe from those who lay in wait for him;
    in his arduous contest she gave him the victory,
    so that he might learn that godliness is more powerful than anything.
    When a righteous man was sold, wisdom[f] did not desert him,
    but delivered him from sin.
    She descended with him into the dungeon,

    At that time Jesus declared, &#8220;I thank thee, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast
    hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to babes; yea, Father,
    for such was thy gracious will. All things have been delivered to me by my Father; and no
    one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and any one to
    whom the Son chooses to reveal him. Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I
    will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am gentle and lowly in
    heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.&#8221;
