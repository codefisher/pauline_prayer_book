<h2>Morning Prayer</h2>

<reading label="Hymn"></reading>

<psalm>
    Hail, Queen of heav’n, the ocean star,
    Guide of the wand’rer here below;
    Thrown on life’s surge, we claim thy care:
    Save us from peril and from woe.
    Mother of Christ, star of the sea,
    Pray for the wand’rer, pray for me.

    O gentle, chaste and spotless maid,
    We sinners make our prayers through thee;
    Remind thy son that he has paid
    The price of our iniquity.
    Virgin most pure, star of the sea,
    Pray for the sinner, pray for me.

    Sojourners in this vale of tears,
    To thee, blest advocate, we cry;
    Pity our sorrow, calm our fears,
    And soothe with hope our misery.
    Refuge in grief, star of the sea,
    Pray for the mourner, pray for me.

    And while to him who reigns above,
    In godhead one, in persons three,
    The source of life, of grace, of love,
    Homage we pay on bended knee;
    Do thou, bright Queen, star of the sea,
    Pray for thy children, pray for me.
</psalm>

    O God, you are my God, for you I long; *
    - for you my soul is thirsting.
    My body pines for you *
    - like a dry, weary land without water.

    So I gaze on you in the sanctuary *
    - to see your strength and your glory.
    For your love is better than life, *
    - my lips will speak your praise.

    So I will bless you all my life, *
    - in your name I will lift up my hands.
    My soul shall be filled as with a banquet, *
    - my mouth shall praise you with joy.

    On my bed I remember you. *
    - On you I muse through the night
    for you have been my help; *
    - in the shadow of your wings I rejoice.
    My soul clings to you; *
    - your right hand holds me fast.

    Sing a new song to the Lord, *

    Let the praise of God be on their lips *
    - and a two-edged sword in their hand,

    to deal out vengeance to the nations *
    - and punishment on all the peoples;
    to bind their kings in chains *
    - and their nobles in fetters of iron;
    to carry out the sentence pre-ordained: *
    - this honour is for all his faithful.

<psalm>
    Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel! *
    - He has visited his people and redeemed them.

    He has raised up for us a mighty saviour *
    - in the house of David his servant,
    as he promised by the lips of holy men, *
    - those who were his prophets from of old.

    A saviour who would free us from our foes, *
    - from the hands of all who hate us.
    So his love for our fathers is fulfilled *
    - and his holy covenant remembered.

    He swore to Abraham our father to grant us, *
    - that free from fear, and saved from the hands of our foes,
    we might serve him in holiness and justice *
    - all the days of our life in his presence.

    As for you, little child, *
    - you shall be called a prophet of God, the Most High.
    You shall go ahead of the Lord *
    - to prepare his ways before him,

    To make known to his people their salvation *
    - through forgiveness of all their sins,
    the loving-kindness of the heart of our God *
    - who visits us like the dawn from on high.

    He will give light to those in darkness, +
    - those who dwell in the shadow of death, *
    - and guide us into the way of peace.
