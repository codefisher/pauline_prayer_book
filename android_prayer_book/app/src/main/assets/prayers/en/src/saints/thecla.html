<h2><span class="rubric">Optional Memorial</span></h2>

<p><em>
    Saint Thecla is thought to have come from Iconium. She was said to have received Baptism from Saint Paul
    the Apostle during his first journey through Asia Minor (the years 45-49). She made a vow of
    chasity and remained unmarried. She accompanied Saint Paul on his journeys, ministering to him. She
    supposedly lived a long life, well into her eighties, of which she spent a significant
    amount as a hermit.
