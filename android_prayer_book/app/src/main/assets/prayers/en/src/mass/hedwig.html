<litany>
    O God, who gave to St Hedwig
    the gift of love and contemplation of Christ crucified,
    that she might wisely serve him with love for her brothers,
    grant even to us that by her intercession
    we may love you with unwearied love in prayer and in works.
    Through our Lord Jesus Christ your Son,
    who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
    one God, for ever and ever.
</litany>
