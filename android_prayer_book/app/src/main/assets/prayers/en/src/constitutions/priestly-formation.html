<h1 class="index">Chapter IV: Priestly Formation</h1>


<h2 id="art92">Article 92</h2>

<p>
    Our Priests have the ongoing obligation to deepen their spiritual, intellectual and pastoral
    formation throughout their entire lives (Can. 661). By virtue of their monastic and priestly
    vocation they are bound toward an ever more perfect charity, to the deepening of their interior
    life, to an updating of knowledge and to become acquainted with more modern methods of Pastoral
    Care. They should be concerned with developing their pastoral skills and whatever else will help
    them to carry out their obligations. By so doing they will become ever more useful in their work
    for the Church and the Order.
</p>


<h2 id="art93">Article 93</h2>

<p>
    Superiors must show special concern for the newly ordained and they must give them the means for
    growth in using methods and initiatives in their personal work. They should create for them
    occasions for mutual sharing with their confreres in matters of Pastoral concern. Above all,
    however, they must provide them with the means for deepening their theological knowledge
    rendering every assistance and creating every condition for strengthening and deepening their
    relationship with Christ the High Priest.
</p>
<p>
    Young Priests assigned to Pastoral ministry both in our Shrines as well as other places should
    give themselves to their Ministry with zeal and concern being guided by their Superiors.
</p>


<h2 id="art94">Article 94</h2>


<ol>
    <li> In the process of on-going formation and in other forms of intellectual growth, young
        Priests must take examinations for the first five years following Ordination. Special
        emphasis should be given to the discussion of the problems that arise in the pastoral
        setting joined with those forms of Pastoral Care which are proper to our Order.
    </li>
    <li> Each of our Fathers should make every effort to use his free time for developing his
        intellectual horizons and Pastoral Skills. To do this he should participate in conferences
        but especially those that concern themselves with Pastoral Ministry.
    </li>


</ol>

<h2 id="art95">Article 95</h2>

<p>
    Those who are sent for higher specialised studies should be distinguished by suitable
    intellectual ability as well as by high moral standards. The decision to assign one for higher
    studies belongs to the Major Superior. He should however; take into account not only that the
    one selected has the required abilities but also the actual needs and means of the Monastic
    Community.
</p>
<p>
    Special care and concern should be shown to those who have gone on for further studies. Concern
    must be made not only for their intellectual progress in their field or studies but above all
    for their spiritual and Pastoral formation.
