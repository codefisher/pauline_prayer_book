<h1 class="index">Chapter IV: Community Life</h1>


<h2 id="norm36">Norm 36</h2>

<p>
    All members of the Community are bound to care that the good name of individuals and the
    Community as a whole does not suffer. Competent Superiors should lead all offenders in these
    matters to accept their rightful responsibility and to make up for whatever harm they have
    caused.
</p>

<h2 id="norm37">Norm 37</h2>

<p>
    All our Houses are bound to observe the general precepts of Canon Law as regards keeping the
    cloister (Can. 667). Accordingly, it is forbidden to bring in women as well as men and young
    people except those members of one’s immediate family and this only with the consent of the
    Superior.
</p>
<p>
    In dealing with persons who come to us with business be it in our parlours or on the telephone,
    we should be direct and to the point always keeping in mind, however, the demands of true love
    of neighbour.
</p>

<h2 id="norm38">Norm 38</h2>

<p>
    Monks who are going outside the cloister or Monastery should first inform the Superior as to the
    purpose of the going out and obtain his permission. There is no need for permission, however, if
    this is demanded by one’s Normal obligations.
    The time for closing the Monastery door should be posted in the schedule of the day.
</p>
<p>
    All those who are going out of the monastery should make this known according to the custom of
    each House. Absence of a member, which will be longer than one week, demands permission from the
    Major superior with the exception of one’s holiday time. If one is leaving for an extended
    period, he should leave the address of where he is going to stay with his Superior.
</p>

<h2 id="norm39">Norm 39</h2>

<p>
    The Subprior is responsible for receiving guests in each of our monasteries. In our larger
    houses, the Prior should name a Prefect for guests who will carry out his obligations in
    accordance with our traditions of hospitality.
</p>

<h2 id="norm40">Norm 40</h2>

<p>
    Monks should not spend the night outside of the Monastery in those places where we have a home
    unless serious reasons warrant.
</p>

<h2 id="norm41">Norm 41</h2>

<p>
    Parents of our brethren should be regarded as special benefactors of the Order. They should be
    treated with the greatest respect and appreciation. They should be received in all our homes in
    a hospitable manner especially on the occasions of professions or ordinations.
</p>
<p>
    Superiors may allow for living in one’s family home be this during vacation or on free days or
    on other extraordinary occasions. If the need arises, in the spirit of the gospel, Superiors
    should lend assistance to the parents of our brethren.
</p>
<p>
    We should share sorrow of our brethren on the occasion of the death of those who are close to
    them. The Superior of the Religious House should see to it that the Monks are able to take part
    in the funeral of parents. Also, Mass should be offered in the Monastery for the response of
    their soul.
</p>

<h2 id="norm42">Norm 42</h2>

<p>
    Our Order feels an obligation of gratitude toward our parents, benefactors, friends and
    Confraters. We give expression to this especially through prayer. On the first Sunday after the
    Solemnity of St. Paul the First Hermit, every Community celebrates a Solemn mass for their
    intentions.
</p>

<h2 id="norm43">Norm 43</h2>

<p>
    As the time draws near for one of our brethren to die, the Superior should see to it, himself,
    or through a designated priest, that the dying confrere is given every assistance in preparing
    to enter eternal life. Immediate preparation should be made of celebrating the Sacrament of the
    Sick as well as seeing to it that he is able to receive Holy Communion daily and, at the right
    moment, to receive Holy Viaticum together with the renewal of Religious Profession. He should
    help in every way possible to see to it that the dying member is able to meet God with a
    peaceful conscience.
</p>
<p>
    As the sick member comes closer to death he should be attended to night and
    day. Meanwhile, the community assists by its prayer. During the last agony the Superior should
    remain with the sick confrere together with a few other members of the Community while all the
    rest pray in the chapel.
    The proper prayers for this occasion are found in the Order’s Ceremonial.
</p>
<p>
    Upon the death of a confrere his body should be clothed in the habit according to our custom
    after which it is transported to a properly prepared place.
</p>

<h2 id="norm44">Norm 44</h2>

<p>
    The Superior should notify the family and those closest to the deceased confrere as well as all
    our Religious Houses regarding the fact of his death and the time of the funeral. Consequently,
    in each Monastery there should be on file the names of all the members of the family together
    with the exact addresses of their relatives and closest friends who should be notified in the
    event of death.
</p>
<p>
    The general governing body once it is informed of the death of a brother includes his name in
    the necrology as found in all the monasteries and makes mention of the deceased in the bulletin.
</p>

<h2 id="norm45">Norm 45</h2>

<p>
    In our concern to assist the souls of our departed confreres, relatives, benefactors and
    confraters, we observe the following Norms:
</p>

<ol class="alph">
    <li> Upon the death of one of our Monks (Priests, Seminarian, Brother or Novice) each Priest of
        the Order will celebrate one Holy Mass, while Seminarians, Brothers and Novices will take
        part in one Holy mass; moreover, all should recite a portion of the rosary;
    </li>
    <li> Gregorian masses should be celebrated in that Monastery of which the deceased was a
        member;
    </li>
    <li> In the case of a departed Priest or Brother, one Mass should be celebrated each year on the
        anniversary of his death for a period of ten years in the monastery of which he was a
        member.
    </li>
    <li> Our Monks should remember their parents, relatives and the benefactors of the Order in
        their prayers. During November in each of our monasteries, one Mass should be celebrated for
        all of the deceased members of our Order, another Mass for the parents and relatives, and a
        third Mass for deceased benefactors and confraters. The members of the Monastery should take
        part in these Masses.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="norm46">Norm 46</h2>

<p>
    All our Houses should have a common burial ground in the cemetery. The graves of our departed
    brothers should be tended to with care and the living should be encouraged to visit the cemetery
    often especially during the month dedicated to the departed.
</p>

<h2 id="norm47">Norm 47</h2>

<p>
    Alongside common prayer and common work a sure means for creating a family atmosphere is common
    recreation, entertainment and rest.
</p>
<p>
    The time, place and forms for recreational activity should be determined by the Community itself
    of any given House.
</p>
<p>
    On the occasion of holidays, various jubilees and feast days and other such occasions which are
    observed by the Community care should be taken that these days be marked by a character and
    spirit which is at once familial, elevated and edifying.
</p>

<h2 id="norm48">Norm 48</h2>

<p>
    All our Monks who are in Solemn Vows are entitled for four weeks holiday per year. They can be
    taken all at once or can be divided into parts. Members in Temporary Vows are entitled to two
    weeks holiday.
</p>
<p>
    Normally vacations are spent in our Communities rest houses. Vacation to one’s family or to
    other places of rest especially health spas, if justified, demand permission of the Superior.
</p>
<p>
    For trips overseas, the permission of the Major superior is required.
</p>
<p>
    The dates for holidays are organised by the Superior taking into account the good of the entire
    Community.
</p>

<h2 id="norm49">Norm 49</h2>

<p>
    Communities should so organise their obligations to assure that each member in Solemn Vows has a
    least one free day a week, either for rest or for tending to personal matters. On this day, the
    Monk is freed observing the horarium of the day. He is able to leave the Monastery with the
    permission of his Superior.
</p>

<h2 id="norm50">Norm 50</h2>

<p>
    The entire Community takes its meals in a common refectory. Gathering around a common table is a
    very significant sign of Community Life. Prayers before and after meals should be recited
    according to monastic tradition.
</p>
<p>
    Before lunch the lector reads a portion of Holy Scripture and once a week during a common meal
    one Chapter of the Constitutions and Directory is read. Other forms of reading as well as
    fraternal dialogue around the table and the times allotted for these are determined by the
    Superior given the conditions and character of the House.
</p>
<p>
    Brothers appointed by the Superior do the serving at table.
    After lunch and supper, the Monks go in procession to the choir for adoration of the most
    Blessed Sacrament either singing or reciting a psalm or a canticle of thanksgiving. They may
    also choose to sing a hymn appropriate to a given liturgical season.
</p>
