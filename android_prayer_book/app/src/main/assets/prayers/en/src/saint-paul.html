<h1>2. St. Paul the First Hermit</h1>

<p class="instruction">
    In the light of the recent studies, St. Paul the First Hermit
    lived in the years between 228 -341. His personality and life style
    harmonizes perfectly with the events and situation of the Church of
    the first centuries. The exact dates are not of great importance but
    the example, as an ideal model of the hermit and his personal un-
    ion with God, remains always a great and worthy attraction for
    Christians to follow.
</p>

<p class="instruction">
    St. Paul the First Hermit is well known among the early
    Fathers of the Church and in the lives of the first anchorites.
    Down the centuries in Pauline Communities, the title “St. Paul the
    First Hermit” was generally accepted and approved by the Holy
    See as an official name of the Order.

</p>

<p class="instruction">
    It was St. Jerome that wrote the life of St. Paul the First
    Hermit. According to his relations, St. Paul was a quite educated
    man in Greek and Egyptian culture. He was endowed with a noble
    and gentle nature towards the people. During the persecution of
    the Church, inspired by the Holy Spirit, he left the family home and
    settled himself in the desert, where “alone with God alone”, he
    spent all his earthy life in prayer and contemplation of God’s mys-
    teries.
</p>

<p class="instruction">
There is no any doubt that St. Paul the First Hermit was a
historical figure. However, many extraordinary stories, related by
St. Jerome (345-420), are not necessarily true or essential. For all
Pauline generations, St. Paul the First Hermit is not only the most
venerable and beloved Patriarch of their Order, but above all a
living symbol of imitation of Christ in the desert that originated in
the past, but still flourishes today and will continue to inspire his
spiritual sons for generations to come.
