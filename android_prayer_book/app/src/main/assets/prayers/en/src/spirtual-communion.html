<h1>3. An Act of Spiritual Holy Communion</h1>

<p class="indent">
O Lord, Jesus Christ, truly present in the Blessed Sacrament,
I believe in you, I adore you and I love you with all my heart. I am
sorry for all my sins, because I desire to receive you in Holy Com-
munion and remain with you. Come, O Jesus to my heart, spiritu-
ally at least and dwell in it forever&hellip;
</p>

<p class="indent">
May the Body of our Lord Jesus Christ guard me for life
everlasting.
</p>

<p class="indent">I welcome you, Jesus into my poor heart. I dedicate
myself totally to you. I am yours in life and in death. Amen.
