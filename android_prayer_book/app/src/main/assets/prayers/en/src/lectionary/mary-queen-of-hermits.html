<p>
    Now a great sign appeared in heaven: a woman, adorned with the sun, standing on the moon, and
    with the twelve stars on her head for a crown. She was pregnant, and in labour, crying aloud in
    the pangs of childbirth. Then a second sign appeared in the sky, a huge red dragon which had
    seven heads and ten horns, and each of the seven heads crowned with a coronet. Its tail dragged
    a third of the stars from the sky and dropped them to the earth, and the dragon stopped in front
    of the woman as she was having the child, so that he could eat it as soon as it was born from
    its mother. The woman brought a male child into the world, the son who was to rule all the
    nations with an iron sceptre, and the child was taken straight up to God and to his throne,
    while the woman escaped into the desert, where God had made a place of safety ready, for her to
    be looked after in the twelve hundred and sixty days.

<reading label="Responsorial Psalm" ref="Luke 1:46-55 R/. 47"></reading>

<p class="noindent"><sp>R/</sp> <strong>My spirit rejoices in God, my Saviour. </strong></p>

<div class="prayer-group">
    <psalm numbers="numbers">
        My soul glorifies the Lord,
        - my spirit rejoices in God, my Saviour.&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>

        He looks on his servant in her nothingness;
        - henceforth all ages will call me blessed.
        The Almighty works marvels for me.
        - Holy his name!&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>

        His mercy is from age to age,
        - on those who fear him.
        He puts forth his arm in strength
        - and scatters the proud-hearted.&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>


        He casts the mighty from their thrones
        - and raises the lowly.
        He fills the starving with good things,
        - sends the rich away empty.&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>

        He protects Israel, his servant,
        - remembering his mercy,
        the mercy promised to our fathers,
        - to Abraham and his sons for ever.&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>

    <strong>Alleluia! Alleluia!</strong><br />
    Get up, take the child and his mother with you, <br />

<reading label="Gospel" ref="2:13-15" tagline="I called my son out of Egypt">A reading from the holy Gospel according to Matthew</reading>

<p>
    After the wise men had left, the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, ‘Get up, take the child and his mother with you, and escape into Egypt, and stay there until I tell you, because Herod intends to search for the child and do away with him.’ So Joseph got up and, taking the child and his mother with him, left that night for Egypt, where he stayed until Herod was dead. This was to fulfil what the Lord had spoken through the prophet:
<em>I called my son out of Egypt.</em>
