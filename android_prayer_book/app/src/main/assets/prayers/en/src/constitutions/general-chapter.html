<h1 class="index">Chapter I: The General Chapter</h1>


<h2 id="art101">Article 101</h2>


<ol>
    <li> The General Chapter ranks as an event of the highest degree in the life of the Pauline
        Order not only for our Community itself but also as an event contributing to the building up
        of the Body of Christ.
    </li>

    <li> The General Chapter exercises the highest authority in the Order, doing so both collegially
        and in the manner defined by law. It is during the Chapter that the election of the Superior
        General takes place, problems are discussed, resolutions undertaken, which then bind all
        members (Can. 631, §. 1).
    </li>

    <li> The Pauline Community expresses during the Chapter its concern for preserving its heritage
        and assumes responsibility for the development of the entire Monastic Family. Its concern
        also is that the Order is faithful to its Mission in the Church and in the world (Can. 578,
        631, §1).
    </li>

    <li> The participants of the General Chapter representing our various Communities must remember
        that they are responsible not only to their own conscience and to the Order for the
        decisions and resolutions, which they will make, but they are answerable to Christ himself
        who is present in a special way during the Chapter.
    </li>


</ol>

<h2 id="art102">Article 102</h2>

<p>
    The Father General is responsible for calling together the General Chapter for elections every
    six years with the consent of his Definitorium. He determines the time and place for this same
    Chapter.
    If for any reason the office of General is left vacant it is the Vicar General who calls
    together the General Chapter with the consent of the Definitorium.
</p>
<p>
    For serious reasons the Father General has the authority to call an extraordinary Chapter in
    agreement with a deciding vote of his Definitorium for matters which concern the Order.
</p>


<h2 id="art103">Article 103</h2>


<ol>
    <li> The members of the General Chapter are: The Father General, The Vicar of the Order,
        Ex-Generals, General Definitors, the Procurator General at the Holy See, the Administrator
        General, the General Secretary, from each province or quasi-province – the Provincial, the
        Quasi Provincial or in case of being legitimately impeded their vicar.
    </li>

    <li> Delegates chosen by the whole Order according to its law should equal in number those
        taking part in the Chapter by virtue of the law itself.
    </li>


</ol>

<h2 id="art104">Article 104</h2>

<p>
    Monks who on the day the Chapter is convened are in Solemn Profession have both active and
    passive voice in the selection of delegates to the General Chapter. Brother seminarians who have
    not yet received priestly orders after their Solemn Vows have an active voice.
</p>
<p>
    Those who by virtue of some other reason have a voice at the General Chapter do not have either
    an active or passive voice in the election of delegates. The same is true of those who according
    to Law and Constitutions have been stripped of such a voice. Among this number are the
    following:
</p>

<ol class="alph">
    <li> Those who have received an indult of secularisation, exclaustration, and those who have
        already submitted a petition for one of these indults;
    </li>
    <li> Those who by reason of sanctions have been stripped of active or passive voice.</li>


</ol>

<h2 id="art105">Article 105</h2>

<p>
    As the General Chapter begins, the Father General or his representative together with the
    Definitorium proceed to the verification of the election of delegates. At the announced time the
    Chapter itself begins in accordance with the statutes of our Order’s Law. The General of the
    Order calls for the election of the scrutineers, the secretary and the Presider of the Chapter
    according to the statutes of the General Directory.
</p>
<p>
    Following this, in the presence of the entire Chapter, the General gives an accounting of his
    time in office, the state of the Order, the implementation of the resolutions taken at the last
    Chapter, as well as the material status of the Order. Next, he tenders his resignation as
    General of the Order to the Presider of the Chapter. Having discussed the report made by the
    General, the Chapter then expresses its opinion by means of a secret vote. Next, the Presider
    calls for the elections.
</p>


<h2 id="art106">Article 106</h2>

<p>
    At an electoral general chapter the following ought to be elected, the Father General of the
    Order, four definitors, one of which may be a religious brother, the Procurator General to the
    Holy See as well as the Administrator General. The Father General with the consent of his
    Definitorium nominates the Secretary General. A religious brother cannot fulfil the office of
    Vicar of the Order.
</p>


<h2 id="art107">Article 107</h2>

<p>
    The General Chapter concerns itself with matters affecting the whole Order especially those,
    which require either the permission or confirmation of the Holy See. It concerns itself in
    detail with persons, Houses, and Provinces as well as the implementation of the goals of the
    Order and its actual mission in the Church. It is the Chapter which decides the program of work
    for various areas both in the life and activity of the Order. It must show special concern with
    the problems concerning formation. It must take into consideration the resolutions of preceding
    General Chapters, and the decisions of the governing body of the Order. It is the Chapter, which
    puts the Directory into actual practice. It makes appropriate resolutions regarding the future.
</p>
<p>
    Prior to the beginning of the General Chapter a questionnaire should be distributed among all
    the members of the Community in order to better become acquainted with the needs of the Order.
</p>


<h2 id="art108">Article 108</h2>


<ol>
    <li> For elections held during the General Chapter, the absolute majority of votes is required,
        as required by general law. (Cf. Can. 119 § 1)However, in accord with the tradition of our
        Order, if in the first, second or even third round of voting, no one received the absolute
        majority, there should be a fourth round of voting, in which passive voice is held by those
        two candidates, who in the third round of voting had the most votes.
    </li>
    <li>
        If they happen to have the same number of votes, then the one elected as Father General,
        shall be the one senior by profession, if they are equal by profession, then the one senior
        by age.
    </li>
    <li>
        The principle of seniority by profession, in accordance with the tradition of the Order,
        applies to all elections in the Order.
    </li>
    <li> Likewise all matters of the general chapter are determined by secret ballot of absolute
        majority. If however after two votes, the votes are equal, if the vote does not pertain to
        an election, then the result is determined by the decision of the Father General or the
        presider.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="art109">Article 109</h2>

<p>
    Within three months after the conclusion of the General Chapter (so long as Provinces are not
    erected) the Father General, having solicited the opinion of those members concerned
    representing various houses of the Order, will in accordance with the statutes of the
    Constitutions name the officers of each of the monasteries.
</p>


<h2 id="art110">Article 110</h2>

<p>
    The resolutions of the General Chapter are a call for and an obligation upon the entire Pauline
    Community. The newly elected general government as well as the Superiors of the individual
    Communities are directly responsible for the implementation of these resolutions.
</p>
<p>
    We regard as a pledge of their salvific effect on the life of our entire Community the perpetual
    protection of Our Lady the Mother of the Order.
</p>


<h2 id="art111">Article 111</h2>

<p>
    In the event that Provinces are revived once more within the Order, the manner of executing the
    General Chapter, namely deliberations, discussions, voting and conclusion are subject to the
    same rules, which bind at the General Chapter with the exception of those specifics, which
    pertain and are proper to only the Chapter.
