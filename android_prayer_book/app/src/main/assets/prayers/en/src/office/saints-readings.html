<psalm>
    To Thy poor servants reconciled
    show mercy, Christ, for whom the mild
    and Virgin Patroness this grace
    implore before Thy Father's face.

    Ye purpled martyrs, you, now dressed
    in white because your lives confessed
    your Lord on earth, us exiles call
    unto the fatherland of all.

    O choir of virgins, stainless band!
    and ye for whom the desert-land
    made sure the way to heavenly rest,
    prepare us mansions with the blest.

    The race perfidious expel
    from regions where the faithful dwell;
    let one sole shepherd be our guide,
    all Christians in one fold abide.

    Glory, O Father! to Thy name;
    eternal Son, to Thine the same;
    to Holy Paraclete be praise
    throughout the everlasting days.

<reading label="First Reading" ref="3:1-17"
         tagline="New life">A reading from the letter of St. Paul to the Colossians
</reading>

<p>
    Since you have been brought back to true life with Christ, you must look for the things that are
    in heaven, where Christ is, sitting at God’s right hand. Let your thoughts be on heavenly
    things, not on the things that are on the earth, because you have died, and now the life you
    have is hidden with Christ in God. But when Christ is revealed&mdash;and he is your life&mdash;you too
    will be revealed in all your glory with him.
</p>
<p>
    That is why you must kill everything in you that belongs only to earthly life: fornication,
    impurity, guilty passion, evil desires and especially greed, which is the same thing as
    worshipping a false god; all this is the sort of behaviour that makes God angry. And it is the
    way in which you used to live when you were surrounded by people doing the same thing, but now
    you, of all people, must give all these things up: getting angry, being bad-tempered,
    spitefulness, abusive language and dirty talk; and never tell each other lies. You have stripped
    off your old behaviour with your old self, and you have put on a new self which will progress
    towards true knowledge the more it is renewed in the image of its creator; and in that image
    there is no room for distinction between Greek and Jew, between the circumcised or the
    uncircumcised, or between barbarian and Scythian, slave and free man. There is only Christ: he
    is everything and he is in everything.
</p>
<p>
    You are God’s chosen race, his saints; he loves you, and you should be clothed in sincere
    compassion, in kindness and humility, gentleness and patience. Bear with one another; forgive
    each other as soon as a quarrel begins. The Lord has forgiven you; now you must do the same.
    Over all these clothes, to keep them together and complete them, put on love. And may the peace
    of Christ reign in your hearts, because it is for this that you were called together as parts of
    one body. Always be thankful.
</p>
<p>
    Let the message of Christ, in all its richness, find a home with you. Teach each other, and
    advise each other, in all wisdom. With gratitude in your hearts sing psalms and hymns and
    inspired songs to God; and never say or do anything except in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving
    thanks to God the Father through him.
</p>

<reading label="Responsory" ref="Gal 3:27-28; Eph 4:24"></reading>

<p class="noindent">
    <sp>R/</sp> All baptised in Christ, you have all clothed yourselves in Christ, and there are no more distinctions between Jew and Greek;
    <span class="rubric">*</span> all of you are one in Christ Jesus.

<reading label="Second Reading" longref="(Liber XIII, cap. 35-38)"
         tagline="Eternal rest after the time of this life">
    From the <em>Confessions</em> of Saint Augustine of Hippo, bishop
</reading>

<p>
    O Lord God, grant Your peace unto us, for You have supplied us with all things — the peace of
    rest, the peace of the Sabbath, which has no evening. For all this most beautiful order of
    things, &ldquo;very good&rdquo; (all their courses being finished), is to pass away, for in them there was
    morning and evening.
</p>

<p>
    But the seventh day is without any evening, nor has it any setting, because You have sanctified
    it to an everlasting continuance, that that which Thou did after Your works, which were very
    good, resting on the seventh day, although in unbroken rest You made them, that the voice of Your
    Book may speak beforehand unto us, that we also after our works (therefore very good, because
    You have given them unto us) may repose in You also in the Sabbath of eternal life.
</p>

<p>
    For even then shall You so rest in us, as now You work in us; and thus shall that be Your rest
    through us, as these are Your works through us. But You, O Lord, always work, and are always at
    rest. Nor do You see in time, nor do You move in time, nor do You rest in time; and yet You make the
    scenes of time, and the times themselves, and the rest which results from time.
</p>

<p>
    We therefore see those things which You made, because they are; but they are, because You see
    them. And we see without, that they are, and within, that they are good, but You saw them there,
    when made, where You saw them to be made. And we were at another time moved to do well, after
    our hearts had conceived of Your Spirit; but in the former time, forsaking You, we were moved to
    do evil; but You, the One, the Good God, hast never ceased to do good. And we also have certain
    good works, of Your gift, but not eternal; after these we hope to rest in Your great hallowing.
    But You, being the Good, needing no good, art ever at rest, because You Yourself art Your rest.
    And what man will teach man to understand this? Or what angel, an angel? Or what angel, a man?
    Let it be asked of You, sought in You, knocked for at You; so, even so shall it be received, so
    shall it be found, so shall it be opened. Amen.
</p>

<reading label="Hymn">Te Deum</reading>

<psalm>
    We praise you, O God: *
    we acclaim you as the Lord.

    - Everlasting Father, *
    - all the world bows down before you.

    All the angels sing your praise, *
    the hosts of heaven and all the angelic powers,

    - all the cherubim and seraphim *
    - call out to you in unending song:

    -- <em>Holy, Holy, Holy,</em> *
    -- <em>is the Lord God of angel hosts!</em>

    The heavens and the earth are filled *
    with your majesty and glory.

    - The glorious band of apostles, *
    - the noble company of prophets,

    the white-robed army who shed their blood for Christ, *
    all sing your praise.

    - And to the ends of the earth *
    - your holy Church proclaims her faith in you:

    -- Father, whose majesty is boundless, +
    -- your true and only Son, who is to be adored, *
    -- the Holy Spirit sent to be our Advocate.

    You, Christ, are the king of glory, *
    Son of the eternal Father.

    - When you took our nature to save mankind *
    - you did not shrink from birth in the Virgin’s womb.

    You overcame the power of death *
    opening the Father’s kingdom to all who believe in you.

    - Enthroned at God’s right hand in the glory of the Father, *
    - you will come in judgement according to your promise.

    You redeemed your people by your precious blood. *
    Come, we implore you, to our aid.

    - Grant us with the saints *
    - a place in eternal glory.

    <span class="instruction">The final part of the hymn may be omitted:</span>

    Lord, save your people *
    and bless your inheritance.

    - Rule them and uphold them *
    - for ever and ever.

    Day by day we praise you: *
    we acclaim you now and to all eternity.

    - In your goodness, Lord, keep us free from sin. *
    - Have mercy on us, Lord, have mercy.

    May your mercy always be with us, Lord, *
    for we have hoped in you.

    - In you, Lord, we put our trust: *
    - we shall not be put to shame.

<litany>
    Almighty ever-living God,
    who ever adorn, protect and keep your Church
    with the various splendours of the Saints,
    graciously grant that,
    by the prayers of Blessed Paul the First Hermit
    and his holy sons and daughters,
    the merits of all of whom you have granted us to honour on one feast day,
    both that we may be purified from every fault here,
    and that we may fully enjoy eternal glory in the future.
    Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
    who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
    one God, for ever and ever.
