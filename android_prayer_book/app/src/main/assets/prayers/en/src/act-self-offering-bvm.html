<h1>13. An act of self-offering to the Most Blessed Virgin Mary
    <span>(A prayer of Novices and Seminarians)</span>
</h1>

<p>
    O My Dearest Mother, My Lady, My Queen and My
    Hope! I consecrate myself totally to you in the presence of Jesus,
    My Lord, abiding now in my heart.
</p>

<p>
    I offer to you my body and my soul. I commend to you,
    My Most Loving Mother, all the activities and sufferings of my
    life, even the smallest. O Mother, for whom nothing is too small or
    too great, be my strongest and never failing support and comfort.
</p>

<p>
    I offer my whole life: minute by minute, hour by hour,
    day by day. In a special way, I commend to you the moment of my
    death, knowing that you will not fail to come. I offer you my Pur-
    gatory and I rejoice at the thought that through my suffering there,
    I will come to you purified.
</p>

<p>
    I offer you my Heaven, my Eternal Heaven, and I rejoice
    at the thought of seeing you there, My Dearest Mother, whom I
    love so dearly and whom I have not yet seen. There, you will make
    me happy, showing me your face!
</p>

<p>
    O My Beloved Mother, I commend to you my religious
    vows, that you may preserve them solely for Jesus. In a special
    way I entrust to you my vows of chastity. As you called yourself a
    “Servant of the Lord”, teach me a great sense of humility of mind
    and heart.
</p>

<p>
    Finally, O Dearest Mother, I ask you with all my heart,
    even today, to say to My Lord, with your blessed lips these four
    words: “Make him a saint.” O My Mother, I beg you for these four
    words! It is so easy for you, but for me, it means an infinite bene-
    fit.
</p>

<p>
    You know how ardently I desire to become a saint, no
    matter how much I should suffer. I do not ask for anything else
    that is in Heaven or on earth. Tell this to Jesus, whom I carry now
    in my heart.
</p>

<p>
    O My Mother, I offer you also Jesus, who is your most
    precious Treasure. O My Mother, I desire nothing in this life; nei-
    ther health, nor happiness nor anything else in the world. Grant me
    only the grace to love Jesus and you and to be with you in Heaven
    forever. Amen.
</p>
