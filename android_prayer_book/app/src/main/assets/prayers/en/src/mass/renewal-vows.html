<h1 class="index">Renewal of Vows
    <span class="rubric">(January 15)</span></h1>

<p class="instruction">
    After the homily, the Creed is omitted. The celebrant calls to prayer:
</p>

<p>
    Let us pray, my dearest brothers, to God the Giver of the grace of perseverance,
    for us, his servants, who fervently desire to renew our vows today before the community
    of the Church.
</p>

<p class="instruction">
    Moment of silence.
</p>

<p>
    Almighty God, look on us, your servants, who you called to evangelical perfection in
    your mysterious plans of providence; graciously grant that we may complete with persevering
    love the ways of your goodness on which we were called with willing heart to enter.
    Through Christ, our Lord. Amen.
</p>

<p class="instruction">
    After the prayer the superior and the community, kneeling down, renew vows according to the following form:
</p>

<litany>
    <strong>I, brother <span class="rubric">N. N.</span>, renew my vows</strong>
    <strong>and I promise Almighty God,</strong>
    <strong>before the Most Blessed Virgin Mary,</strong>
    <strong>Mother and unique Patroness of our Order</strong>
    <strong>and Saint Paul the First Hermit,</strong>
    <strong>chastity, poverty and obedience to my superiors,</strong>
    <strong>according to the Constitutions of the Order.</strong>
    <strong>Once again, I give and dedicate myself to God</strong>
    <strong>through the motherly hands of Mary,</strong>
    <strong>so that I may fervently strive for sanctity;</strong>
    <strong>and thereby serve and worship Him with all my being.</strong>
    <strong>Moreover I desire and declare with all my heart</strong>
    <strong>to strive for salvation of myself and my neighbours</strong>
    <strong>for the greater glory of God</strong>
    <strong>according to his holy will.</strong>
    <strong>&ldquo;Never leave me, never forsake me,</strong>
    <strong>God, my Saviour.&rdquo; <span class="rubric">Ps. 26(27):9</span></strong>
</litany>

    After the renewal of vows all stand and the superior begins the general intercessions.
