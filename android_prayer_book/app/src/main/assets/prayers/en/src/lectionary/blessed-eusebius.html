<p>
    I believe nothing can happen that will outweigh the supreme advantage of knowing Christ Jesus my
    Lord. For him I have accepted the loss of everything, and I look on everything as so much
    rubbish if only I can have Christ and be given a place in him. I am no longer trying for
    perfection by my own efforts, the perfection that comes from the Law, but I want only the
    perfection that comes through faith in Christ, and is from God and based on faith. All I want is
    to know Christ and the power of his resurrection and to share his sufferings by reproducing the
    pattern of his death. That is the way I can hope to take my place in the resurrection of the
    dead. Not that I have become perfect yet: I have not yet won, but I am still running, trying to
    capture the prize for which Christ Jesus captured me. I can assure you my brothers, I am far
    from thinking that I have already won. All I can say is that I forget the past and I strain
    ahead for what is still to come; I am racing for the finish, for the prize to which God calls us
    upwards to receive in Christ Jesus.

    Preserve me, God, I take refuge in you.

    I will bless the Lord who gives me council,

    I keep the Lord ever in my sight:
    - since he is at my right hand, I shall stand firm.&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>

    You will show me the path of life,
    - the fullness of joy in your presence,

<reading label="Gospel" ref="9:57-62" tagline="I will follow you wherever you go">
    A reading from the holy Gospel according to Luke
</reading>

<p>
    As Jesus and his disciples travelled along they met a man on the road who said to him, &lsquo;I
    will follow you wherever you go.&rsquo; Jesus answered, &lsquo;Foxes have holes and the birds of
    the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
    Another to whom he said, &lsquo;Follow me&rsquo;, replied, &lsquo;Let me go and bury my father
    first.&rsquo; But he answered, &lsquo;Leave the dead to bury their dead; your duty is to go and
    spread the news of the kingdom of God.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
    Another said, &lsquo;I will follow you, sir, but first let me go and say goodbye to my people at
    home.&rsquo; Jesus said to him, &lsquo;Once the hand is laid on the plough, no one who looks
    back is fit for the kingdom of God.&rsquo;
</p>
