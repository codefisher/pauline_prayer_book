    <prayer class="leader" red="L.">
        O Mother of the Church! Remember most gracious
        Virgin Mary, our Queen, the Mother of our vocations
        and the Lady of our hearts, that we are a part of the
        chosen heritage of your Son, Jesus Christ. You were
        present at the birth of our Order and supported the
        founding Holy Fathers and patriarchs with your ma-
        ternal inspirations.<br />
        O Mediatrix of all graces! Throughout the centuries, with
        your countless graces, you have generously enriched
        our brothers.<br />
        O Good Protectress! With your protective mantle you
        have shielded us against the coldness and malice of the
        world with its falsehood and perversity.<br />
        O Good Mother! Behold, we stand before you once
        again, and admit, that you are not loved enough in the
        Religious Families of the Church today. However, fol-
        lowing the great and noble example of our national tra-
        ditions and being aware of the seriousness of the present
        moment and encouraged by our Church leaders, we wish
        to foster in our Polish religious houses an intimate, child-
        like love and attachment for you, our Lady and our
        Queen. With a spirit of responsibility for the solemn
        vows of the Nation, pronounced on the threshold of the
        Great Jubilee of Polandâ€™s Baptism, we renew our own
        religious vows, to live in holiness and to lead the Nation
        to Christ, the Light. Therefore, today, we come to you
        again, O Our Lady, with faith and full of confidence, to
        pay due homage of thanksgiving, honour and dedication.
    </prayer>
    <prayer red="All">
        We thank you, Our Lady, for all graces that we have re-
        ceived from your maternal hands. We thank you for the
        grace of our vocation to the consecrated life, for that of our
        brothers and for those whom you will send to us.<br />
        We thank you for a thousand years of the consecrated life
        in our Homeland.<br />
        We thank you for all our joys and sorrow, for rest and lei-
        sure, for the fruits of our labour and the disappointments we
        have encountered.<br />
