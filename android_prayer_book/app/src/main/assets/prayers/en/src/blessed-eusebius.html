<h1>3. Blessed Eusebius</h1>

<p class="instruction">
    Blessed Eusebius is considered a co-founder of the Order
    of the Brothers of St. Paul the First Hermit. From his initiatives the
    Pauline Order began to exist in Hungary in 1250. It was created
    from the two joined monasteries of hermits living in the Danube
    River forests: the Monastery of St. Jacob, situated upon the hill of
    Patacs and the Monastery of the Holy Cross. Blessed Eusebius, a
    Canon of Esztergom (lat. Strigonium) during the invasion of Turks
    in 1241, running for his life, found safety in the forests of Pecs,
    where he encountered many saintly men living individually in se-
    clusion. In 1246 he gathered them together in the Monastery of the
    Holy Cross. By doing this, he laid the foundation for the religious
    community that lived under the rule of Bishop Bartholomew. Prac-
    tically, he was the first provincial of the new Order which since
    1250 has accepted a title: “Order of the Brothers of St. Paul the
    First Hermit.” In 1263 at the first General Chapter this title was
    approved, and in 1308 sanctioned by Pope Clement V and con-
    veyed to them by Cardinal Gentilis. Because of his efforts to estab-
    lish and gain approval from the Holy See of the new religious com-
    munity and because of his saintly life, Eusebius, has enjoyed great popularity
    among the people since his death in 1270. They venerated him like
    a canonized Saint. His labours produced many blessed
    fruits of holiness in the many members of the Order he founded. In
    popular devotion he is invoked as “Blessed.”
