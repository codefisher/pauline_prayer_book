<h2>Morning Prayer</h2>

<reading label="Hymn"></reading>

<psalm>
    O Blessed Eusebius, our holy joy,
    To you we raise our voices;
    With song overflowing our humble hearts,
    And praise you to the highest heaven.

    Deign to impassion one and all
    United with you in prayer,
    That we be able to change for the better,
    The adversity of our beloved Homeland.

    When sorrows depress our poor spirit,
    May your fervent prayers tendered to God
    Allow all hearts to be lifted up too,
    And banish forever inner turmoil.

    The sunrise enlightened the skies,
    Scattered the gloomy night's darkness;
    Heaven has harkened to your pleas,
    Thus filling your soul with its light.

    With enlivened hearts we submit our needs,
    Not for vain treasures of earth;
    But preserved our young from all taint of sin,
    Blossoming instead with your holy virtues.

    Feel so inclined to enkindle our souls
    United with you in prayer,
    That we be able to change for the better
    The disorder of our beloved Homeland.
    Amen.

    Let us call on God our Lord, who is merciful and full of compassion, and say with one heart and mind: <br />  <sp>R/</sp> <em> Let your eyes be open to the prayer of your servants.</em>
    Lord, who descended to Moses through a cloud and fire, and spoke with him face to face, just as a man is wont to speak to his friend;
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span> by the intercession of Blessed Eusebius our Father, take away our sins and free us from evil.&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>
    God, who, drawing from the Spirit that was in Moses, granted it also to his friends;
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span> fill us also with the spirit of Blessed Eusebius our Father, who in solitude sought you and the salvation of those nearest him.&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>
    Lord, who wish that we may seek not the things of earth but those above;
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span> help us to imitate Blessed Eusebius our Father, so that we may die to sin and the world, and our life may be hidden in Christ with you.&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>
    Lord, who are full of pity and merciful, patient and deeply compassionate;
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span> receive our prayers and acts of repentance which we offer you following the example of Blessed Eusebius our Father.&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>
    Lord, who taught that we should always pray, contemplate the things of heaven and discover the love you bear us;
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span> grant that we may see you face to face in heaven in communion with our fathers Saint Paul, our First Hermit, and Blessed Eusebius and all the saints of the Pauline Order.&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>

    O God, who called Blessed Eusebius
    into the wilderness of Pilis out of his love for you,
    that there he might offer his life in propitiation for the people
    and gather the scattered hermits,
    grant, we beseech you, that through his life and intercession
    our order may be made one in faith and love.
    Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
    who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
    one God, for ever and ever.
