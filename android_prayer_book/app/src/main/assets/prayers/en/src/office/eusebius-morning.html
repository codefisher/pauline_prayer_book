<h2>Morning Prayer</h2>

<reading label="Hymn"></reading>

<psalm>
    O Blessed Eusebius, our holy joy
    To you we raise our voices
    With song overflowing our humble hearts
    And praise you to the highest heaven

    Deign to impassion one and all
    United with you in prayer
    That we be able to change for the better
    The adversity of our beloved Homeland

    When sorrows depress our poor spirit
    May your fervent prayers tendered to God
    Allow all hearts to be lifted up too
    And banish forever inner turmoil

    The sunrise enlightened the skies
    Scattered the gloomy night's darkness
    Heaven has karkened to your pleas
    Thus filling your soul with its light

    With enlivened hearts we submit our needs
    Not for vain treasures of earth
    But preserved our young from all taint of sin
    Blossoming in-stead with your holy virtues

    Feel so inclined to enkindle our souls
    United with you in prayer
    That we be able to change for the better
    The disorder of our beloved Homeland.
    Amen.
</psalm>

<psalm>
    O God, you are my God, for you I long; *
    - for you my soul is thirsting.
    My body pines for you *
    - like a dry, weary land without water.

    So I gaze on you in the sanctuary *
    - to see your strength and your glory.
    For your love is better than life, *
    - my lips will speak your praise.

    So I will bless you all my life, *
    - in your name I will lift up my hands.
    My soul shall be filled as with a banquet, *
    - my mouth shall praise you with joy.

    On my bed I remember you. *
    - On you I muse through the night
    for you have been my help; *
    - in the shadow of your wings I rejoice.
    My soul clings to you; *
    - your right hand holds me fast.

<psalm>
    Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel! *
    - He has visited his people and redeemed them.

    He has raised up for us a mighty saviour *
    - in the house of David his servant,
    as he promised by the lips of holy men, *
    - those who were his prophets from of old.

    A saviour who would free us from our foes, *
    - from the hands of all who hate us.
    So his love for our fathers is fulfilled *
    - and his holy covenant remembered.

    He swore to Abraham our father to grant us, *
    - that free from fear, and saved from the hands of our foes,
    we might serve him in holiness and justice *
    - all the days of our life in his presence.

    As for you, little child, *
    - you shall be called a prophet of God, the Most High.
    You shall go ahead of the Lord *
    - to prepare his ways before him,

    To make known to his people their salvation *
    - through forgiveness of all their sins,
    the loving-kindness of the heart of our God *
    - who visits us like the dawn from on high.

    He will give light to those in darkness, +
    - those who dwell in the shadow of death, *
    - and guide us into the way of peace.

    Lord, who descended to Moses through a cloud and fire and spoke with him face to face, just as a man is wont to speak to his friend,
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span> by the intercession of Blessed Eusebius our Father take away our sins and free us from evil. <sp>R/</sp>
    God, who, drawing from the Spirit that was in Moses, granted it also to his friends,
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span> fill us also with the spirit of Blessed Eusebius our Father, who in solitude sought you and the salvation of those nearest him.  <sp>R/</sp>
    Lord, who wish that we may seek not the things of earth but those above,
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span> help us to imitate Blessed Eusebius our Father so that we may die to sin and the world, and our life may be hidden in Christ with you. <sp>R/</sp>
    Lord, who are full of pity and merciful, patient and deeply compassionate,
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span> receive our prayers and acts of repentance which we offer you following the example of Blessed Eusebius our Father.  <sp>R/</sp>
    Lord, who taught that we should always pray, contemplate the things of heaven and discover the love you bear us,
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span> grant that we may see you face to face in heaven in common with our fathers Saint Paul, our First Hermit, and Blessed Eusebius and all the saints of the Pauline Order.  <sp>R/</sp>

<litany>O God, who called the Blessed Eusebius
    into the wilderness of Pilis out of love towards you,
    that there he might offer his life in propitiation for the people
    and gather the scattered hermits,
    grant, we beseech you, that for the sake of his life and intercession
    our order may be made one in faith and love.
    Through our Lord Jesus Christ your Son,
    who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
    one God, for ever and ever.
