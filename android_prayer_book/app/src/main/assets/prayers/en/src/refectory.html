<h4>Christmas Vigil Supper</h4>

<p class="instruction">
    All the Community gathers in the refectory. At the
    beginning, the Superior or a Cantor sings an appropriate
    Christmas carol. During the singing all lights should be lit. After
    the song, a part of the Holy Scripture should be read that relates
    the story of Jesus Christ’s birth (e.g. Lk 2:1-20). Next, the
    Superior says a prayer, as designated below, expresses his wishes
    to the Community and invites those present to exchange their
    Christmas wishes individually, while breaking the wafer. During
    the Christmas vigil meal we sing carols.
</p>

<div class="prayer-group">
    <prayer red="L.">O Lord, Almighty God, bless <span class="cross">†</span> us, this holy wafer and
        this Christmas meal. Give us the grace to understand
        your love, your mercy and the goodness you have
        shown through the Nativity of your Son, Jesus Christ.
        We commend to you all the people of the world who
        as a consequence of famine, war, hatred and suffering
        cannot fully experience your love. Open our eyes and
        our hearts to all who expect of us our love, especially
        the poor, the sick, the abandoned and also our parents,
        relatives and benefactors. May this sacred Christmas
        Vigil inspire us so that in our behaviour everyone may
        recognize that you, O God, are the Father of us all.
        Through Christ our Lord.
