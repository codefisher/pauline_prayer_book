<h1 class="index" id="hymns">Hymns for the Common of the Blessed Virgin Mary</h1>

<psalm red="42">
    Star of sea and ocean,
    gateway to man's haven,
    mother of our Maker,
    hear our pray'r, O Maiden.

    Welcoming the <em>Ave</em>
    of God's simple greeting
    you have borne a Saviour
    far beyond all dreaming.

    Loose the bonds that hold us
    bound in sin's own blindness
    that with eyes now open'd
    God's own light may guide us.

    Show yourself our mother
    he will hear your pleading
    whom your womb has sheltered
    and whose hand brings healing.

    Gentlest of all virgins,
    that our love be faithful
    keep us from all evil
    gentle, strong, and grateful.

    Guard us through life's dangers
    never turn and leave us,
    may our hope find harbor
    in the calm of Jesus.

    Sing to God our Father
    through the Son who saves us
    joyful in the Spirit
    everlasting praises.

<psalm red="43">
    Maiden yet a mother,
    Daughter of thy Son,
    High beyond all other&mdash;
    Lowlier is none;
    Thou the consummation
    Planning by God’s decree,
    When our lost creation
    Nobler rose in thee!

    Thus his day prepared,
    He who all things made
    ‘mid his creature tarried,
    In thy bosom laid;
    There his love he nourished&mdash;
    Warmth that gave increase
    To the root whence flourished
    Our eternal peace.

    Nor alone thou hearest
    When thy name we hail;
    Often thou art nearest
    When our voices fail;
    Mirrored in thy fashion
    All creation's good,
    Mercy, might, compassion
    Grace thy womanhood.

    Lady, lest our vision
    Striving heavenward, fail,
    Still let they petition
    With thy Son prevail,
    Unto whom all merit,
    Power and majesty,
    With the Holy Spirit
    And the Father be.

<psalm red="44">
    Mary, crowned with living light,
    Temple of the Lord,
    Place of peace and holiness,
    Shelter of the Word.

    Mystery of sinless life
    In our fallen race,
    Free from shadow you reflect
    Plenitude of grace.

    Virgin-mother of our God,
    Lift us when we fall,
    Who were named upon the Cross
    Mother of us all.

    Father, Son and Holy Ghost,
    Heaven sings your praise,
    Mary magnifies your name
    Through eternal days.

<psalm red="45">
    Hail, Queen of heav’n, the ocean star,
    Guide of the wand’rer here below;
    Thrown on life’s surge, we claim thy care:
    Save us from peril and from woe.
    Mother of Christ, star of the sea,
    Pray for the wand’rer, pray for me.

    O gentle, chaste and spotless maid,
    We sinners make our prayers through thee;
    Remind thy son that he has paid
    The price of our iniquity.
    Virgin most pure, star of the sea,
    Pray for the sinner, pray for me.

    Sojourners in this vale of tears,
    To thee, blest advocate, we cry;
    Pity our sorrow, calm our fears,
    And soothe with hope our misery.
    Refuge in grief, star of the sea,
    Pray for the mourner, pray for me.

    And while to him who reigns above,
    In godhead one, in persons three,
    The source of life, of grace, of love,
    Homage we pay on bended knee;
    Do thou, bright Queen, star of the sea,
    Pray for thy children, pray for me.

<psalm red="46">
    God, who made the earth and sky
    And the changing sea,
    Clothed his glory in our flesh:
    Man, with man to be.

    Mary, Virgin filled with light,
    Chosen from our race,
    Bore the Father's only Son
    By the Spirit's grace.

    He whom nothing can contain,
    No one can compel,
    Bound his timeless Godhead here,
    In our time to dwell.

    God, our Father, Lord of days,
    And his only Son,
    WIth the Holy Spirit praise:
    Trinity in One.

<psalm red="47">
    Queen, on whose starry brow doth rest
    The crown of perfect maidenhood,
    The God who made thee, from thy breast
    Drew, for our sakes, his earthly food.

    The grace that sinful Eve denied,
    With thy Child-bearing, reappears;
    Heaven's lingering door, set open wide,
    Welcomes the children of her tears.

    Gate, for such royal progress meet,
    Beacon, whose rays such light can give,
    Look, who the ransomed nations greet
    The virgin-womb that bade them live!

    O Jesus, whom the Virgin bore,
    Be praise and glory unto thee;
    Praise to the Father evermore
    And his life-giving Spirit be.
