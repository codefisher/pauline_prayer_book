<h2>Evening Prayer II</h2>

<reading label="Hymn"></reading>

<psalm>
    Star of sea and ocean,
    gateway to man's haven,
    mother of our Maker,
    hear our pray'r, O Maiden.

    Welcoming the <em>Ave</em>
    of God's simple greeting
    you have borne a Saviour
    far beyond all dreaming.

    Loose the bonds that hold us
    bound in sin's own blindness
    that with eyes now open'd
    God's own light may guide us.

    Show yourself our mother
    he will hear your pleading
    whom your womb has sheltered
    and whose hand brings healing.

    Gentlest of all virgins,
    that our love be faithful
    keep us from all evil
    gentle, strong, and grateful.

    Guard us through life's dangers
    never turn and leave us,
    may our hope find harbor
    in the calm of Jesus.

    Sing to God our Father
    through the Son who saves us
    joyful in the Spirit
    everlasting praises.

    - there to práise the Lord’s náme.
    Thére were set the thrónes of júdgement *
    - of the hóuse of Dávid.

    For the péace of Jerúsalem práy: *

    Let us praise God the Father, who chose Mary as the mother of his Son, and wanted all generations to call her blessed. With confidence we pray: <br />  <sp>R/</sp> <em> May the Virgin Mary intercede for us.</em>
    Father, you have looked on the Virgin Mary and made her the mother of mercy;
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span>may those who are in danger experience the depth of her love.&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>
    You called Mary to be the mother in the house of Jesus and Joseph;
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span>through her prayers, help all mothers to make their homes places of love and holiness.&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>
    You gave Mary the strength to stand beneath the cross and made her radiant with joy in the resurrection;
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span>raise up the sorrowful, and transform their lives with hope.&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>
    Mary was your faithful handmaid who treasured your words in her heart;
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span>through her intercession let us become true disciples of your Son, devoted to his service.&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>
    Father you exalted the Virgin Mary and crowned her Queen of Heaven;
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span>may the dead enter your kingdom and rejoice with your saints for ever.&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>

<reading label="Concluding Prayer"></reading>

<litany>
    O Almighty and Merciful God,
    you have wondrously established the most Blessed Virgin Mary
    to be the perpetual help and defence of the Christian people,
    and made her holy image at Jasna Gora renowned
    by the solemn veneration of the faithful.
    Graciously grant that defended by her protection
    as we fight the battle of life,
    may we be victorious over the evil spirits at the hour of our death.
    Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Your Son,
    who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
    one God for ever and ever.
</litany>
