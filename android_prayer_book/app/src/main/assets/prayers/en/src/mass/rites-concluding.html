<litany class="strong">
The Lord be with you.

Blessed be the name of the Lord.

<litany class="strong">
Our help is in the name of the Lord.
</litany>

<p class="rubric">All reply:</p>

<p class="noindent">
Who made heaven and earth.

<litany class="strong">
May almighty God bless you,

</litany>

<p class="rubric">All:</p>

<p class="noindent">
Amen.

<p class="noindent">Thanks be to God.</p>

After making a profound bow with the ministers, he withdraws.
