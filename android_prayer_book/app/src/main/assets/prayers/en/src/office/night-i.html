<h1 class="index" id="night">Night Prayer I</h1>

<reading label="Hymn"></reading>

<psalm>
    Abide with me: fast falls the eventide;
    the darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide;
    when other helpers fail and comforts flee,
    help of the helpless, O abide with me.

    Swift to its close ebbs out life’s little day;
    earth’s joys grow dim, its glories pass away;
    change and decay in all around I see:
    O thou who changest not, abide with me.

    Hold thou thy cross before my closing eyes;
    shine through the gloom, and point me to the skies;
    heaven’s morning breaks, and earth’s vain shadows flee;
    in life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.
</psalm>

    <em>The Lord reaised him from the dead and made him worthy of all admiration</em> (St. Augustine)
</p>

<psalm>
    When I cáll, ánswer me, O Gód of jústice; *
    - from ánguish you reléased me, have mércy and héar me!

    O mén, how lóng will your héarts be clósed, *
    - will you lóve what is fútile and séek what is fálse?

    It is the Lórd who grants fávours to thóse whom he lóves; *
    - the Lórd héars me whenéver I cáll him.

    Fear him; do not sín: pónder on your béd and be stíll *
    - Make jústice your sácrifice, and trúst in the Lórd.

    ‘What can bríng us háppiness?’ mány sáy. *
    - Líft up the líght of your fáce on us, O Lórd.

    You have pút into my héart a gréater jóy *
    - than théy have from abúndance of córn and new wíne.

    I will líe down in péace and sléep comes at ónce *
    - for yóu alone, Lórd, make me dwéll in sáfety.

Ave Regina caelorum!
Ave, Domina angelorum;
