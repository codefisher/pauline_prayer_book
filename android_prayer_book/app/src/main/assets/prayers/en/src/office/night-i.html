<reading label="Hymn"></reading>

<psalm>
    Abide with me; fast flows the eventide;
    The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide;
    When other helpers fail, and comforts flee,
    Help of the helpless, O abide with me.

    Swift to its close ebbs out life’s little day:
    Earth’s joys grow dim, its glories pass away;
    Change and decay in all around I see;
    O thou who changes not, abide with me.

    Hold thou thy Cross before my closing eyes;
    Shine through the gloom, and point me to the skies;
    Heaven’s morning breaks, and earth’s vain shadows flee;
    In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.
</psalm>

<p>
    <em>The Lord reaided him from the dead and made him worthy of all admiration</em> (St Augustine)
</p>

<psalm>
    When I call, answer me, O God of justice; *
    - from anguish you released me, have mercy and hear me!

    O men, how long will your hearts be closed, *
    - will you love what is futile and seek what is false?

    It is the Lord who grants favours to those whom he loves; *
    - the Lord hears me whenever I call him.

    Fear him; do not sin: ponder on your bed and be still. *
    - Make justice your sacrifice and trust in the Lord.

    ‘What can bring us happiness?’, many say. *
    - Let the light of your face shine on us, O Lord.

    You have put into my heart a greater joy *
    - than they have from abundance of corn and new wine.

    I will lie down in peace and sleep comes at once *
    - for you alone, Lord, make me dwell in safety.

    <em>Praise our God, all you his servants, and all who revere him, both great and small</em> (Rev 19:5)
</p>

<psalm>
    O come, bless the Lord, *
    - all you who serve the Lord,
    who stand in the house of the Lord, *
    - in the courts of the house of our God.

    Lift up your hands to the holy place *
    - and bless the Lord through the night.

    May the Lord bless you from Sion, *
    - he who made both heaven and earth.

<p>
    Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God is one Lord; and you shall love the Lord your God with all your
    heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might. And these words which I command you this
    day shall be upon your heart; and you shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall
    talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down,
    and when you rise.

<psalm>
Ave Regina caelorum!
Ave, Domina angelorum;
Salve radix, salve porta
Ex qua mundo lux est orta.

Gaude, Virgo gloriosa,
Super omnes speciosa.
Vale, O valde decora!
Et pro nobis Christum exora
