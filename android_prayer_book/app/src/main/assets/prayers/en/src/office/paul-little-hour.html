<h2>Prayer During the Day</h2>

<reading label="Hymn"></reading>

<psalm>
    This is the day whereon the Lord’s true witness,
    Whom all the nations lovingly do honour,
    Worthy at last was found to wear forever
    - Glory transcendent.

    Oft hath it been thro’ his sublime deserving
    Poor human bodies, howsoever stricken,
    Broke and cast off the bondage of their sickness
    - Healed divinely.

    Healing and power, grace and beauteous honour
    Always be His, who shining in the highest,
    Ruleth and keepeth all the world’s vast order,
    - One God three Persons.
</psalm>

<psalm>
    To yóu have I lífted up my éyes, *
    - you who dwéll in the héavens;
    my éyes, like the éyes of sláves *
    - on the hánd of their lórds.

    Líke the éyes of a sérvant *
    - on the hánd of her místress,
    so our éyes are on the Lórd our Gód *
    - till he shów us his mércy.

    Have mércy on us, Lórd, have mércy. *
    - We are fílled with contémpt.
    Indéed all too fúll is our sóul +
    - with the scórn of the rích, *
    - with the próud man’s disdáin.
</psalm>

<reading shorttag="Our help is in the name of the Lord" ref="Psalm 123 (124)"></reading>

<psalm>
    &lsquo;If the Lórd had not béen on our síde,&rsquo; *
    - this is Ísrael’s sóng.
    &lsquo;If the Lórd had not béen on our síde *
    - when mén rose up agáinst us,
    thén would they have swállowed us alíve *
    - when their ánger was kíndled.

    &lsquo;Thén would the wáters have engúlfed us, *
    - the tórrent gone óver us;
    óver our héad would have swépt *
    - the ráging wáters.&rsquo;

    Bléssed be the Lórd who did not gíve us *
    - a préy to their téeth!
    Our lífe, like a bírd, has escáped *
    - from the snáre of the fówler.

    Indéed the snáre has been bróken *
    - and wé have escáped.
    Our hélp is in the náme of the Lórd, *
    - who made héaven and éarth.
</psalm>

<reading shorttag="The Lord, the protector of his people" ref="Psalm 124 (125)"></reading>

<psalm>
    Thóse who put their trúst in the Lórd +
    - are like Mount Síon, that cánnot be sháken, *
    - that stánds for éver.

    Jerúsalem! The móuntains surróund her, +
    - so the Lórd surróunds his péople *
    - both nów and for éver.

    For the scéptre of the wícked shall not rést *
    - over the lánd of the júst
    for féar that the hánds of the júst *
    - should túrn to évil.

    Do góod, Lord, to thóse who are góod, *
    - to the úpright of héart;
    but the cróoked and thóse who do évil, *
    - dríve them awáy!

    On Ísrael, péace!

<p>
    They were dressed in the skins of sheep and goats; they were penniless and were given nothing
    but ill-treatment. They were too good for the world and they went out to live in deserts
    and mountains and in caves and ravines.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
    <sp>V/</sp> The saints, who relied on the Lord.

<reading label="Short Reading" ref="Wis 3:1a, 2-3"></reading>

<p>
    The souls of the virtuous are in the hands of God. In the eyes of the unwise, they did appear
    to die, their going looked like a disaster, their leaving us like annihilation; but they
    are in peace.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
    <sp>V/</sp> I put my hope in the Lord, I shall not fear.

<p>
    Nothing therefore can come between us and the love of Christ, even if we are troubled or
    worried, or being persecuted, or lacking food or clothes, or being threatened or even attacked.
    These are the trials through which we triumph, by the power of him who loved us.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
    <sp>V/</sp> Your sorrow will be turned to joy.
    <br />
    <sp>R/</sp> And your joy no one will ever take away.

<litany>God, you granted that Saint Paul, our Father,
    achieve sanctity in the desert,
    grant through his intercession,
    that we, who are striving to develop
    in ourselves a spirit of prayer and service,
    may come ever closer to you in love.
    Through Christ our Lord.
</litany>
