    A reading from the Encyclical Letter <em>Dives in Misericordia</em> by John Paul II, Pope
</reading>

<p>
    The cross of Christ on Calvary is also a witness to the strength of evil against the very Son of
    God.
</p>

<p>
    And here, precisely in Him, in Christ, justice is done to sin at the price of His sacrifice, of
    His obedience &ldquo;even to death.&rdquo; (Phil. 2:8) He who was without sin, &ldquo;God made him sin for our
    sake.&rdquo; (2 Cor. 5:21)
    Justice is also brought to bear upon death, which from the beginning of man&rsquo;s history had been
    allied to sin. Death has justice done to it at the price of the death of the one who was without
    sin and who alone was able-by means of his own death-to inflict death upon death. (cf. 1 Cor
    15:54) In this way
    the cross of Christ, on which the Son, consubstantial with the Father, renders full justice to
    God, is also a radical revelation of mercy, or rather of the love that goes against what
    constitutes the very root of evil in the history of man: against sin and death.
</p>

<p>
    In the paschal mystery the limits of the many sided evil in which man becomes a sharer during
    his earthly existence are surpassed: the cross of Christ, in fact, makes us understand the
    deepest roots of evil, which are fixed in sin and death; thus the cross becomes an
    eschatological sign. Only in the eschatological fulfillment and definitive renewal of the world
    will love conquer, in all the elect, the deepest sources of evil, bringing as its fully mature
    fruit the kingdom of life and holiness and glorious immortality.
</p>

<p>
    Until &ldquo;the former things pass away,&rdquo; (Rev. 21:4) the cross will remain the point of reference for other
    words too of the Revelation of John: &ldquo;Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears my
    voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with him and he with me.&rdquo; (Rev. 3:20) In a special way,
    God also reveals His mercy when He invites man to have &ldquo;mercy&rdquo; on His only Son, the crucified
    one.
</p>

<p>
    In fact, Christ, whom the Father &ldquo;did not spare&rdquo; (Rom. 8:32) for the sake of man and who in His passion
    and in the torment of the cross did not obtain human mercy, has revealed in His resurrection the
    fullness of the love that the Father has for Him and, in Him, for all people. &ldquo;He is not God of
    the dead, but of the living.&rdquo; (Mk 12:27) In His resurrection Christ has revealed the God of merciful
    love, precisely because He accepted the cross as the way to the resurrection.
</p>

<p>
    Here is the Son of God, who in His resurrection experienced in a radical way mercy shown to
    Himself, that is to say the love of the Father which is more powerful than death. And it is also
    the same Christ, the Son of God, who at the end of His messianic mission &mdash; and, in a certain
    sense, even beyond the end &mdash; reveals Himself as the inexhaustible source of mercy, of the same
    love that, in a subsequent perspective of the history of salvation in the Church, is to be
    everlastingly confirmed as more powerful than sin. The paschal Christ is the definitive
    incarnation of mercy, its living sign in salvation history and in eschatology. In the same
    spirit, the liturgy of Eastertide places on our lips the words of the Psalm: Misericordias
    Domini in aeternum cantabo. (Ps. 89 [88]:2)

    O God, glory of the faithful and life of the just,
    by the death and resurrection of whose son we are redeemed,
    be favorable to your servants the departed brothers, relatives and benefactors of our Order,
    so that they who have professed the mystery of your resurrection
    may merit to receive the joys of eternal happiness.
    Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Your Son,
    who lives and reigns with You in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
    one God for ever and ever.
