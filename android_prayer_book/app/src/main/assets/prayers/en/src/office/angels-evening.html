<h2>Evening Prayer</h2>

<reading label="Hymn"></reading>

<psalm>
    They come, God’s messengers of love,
    They come from realms of peace above,
    From homes of never fading light,
    From blissful mansions ever bright.

    They come to watch around us here,
    To soothe our sorrow, calm our fear:
    Ye heavenly guides, speed not away,
    God willeth you with us to stay.

    But chiefly at its journey’s end
    ’Tis yours the spirit to befriend,
    And whisper to the faithful heart,
    &lsquo;O Christian soul, in peace depart.&rsquo;

    To us the zeal of angels give,
    With love to serve thee while we live;
    To us an Angel-guard supply,
    When on the bed of death we lie.
</psalm>

<p class="ref">Psalm 33 (34)</p>
<psalm>
    I will bléss the Lórd at all tímes, *
    his práise álways on my líps;
    in the Lórd my sóul shall make its bóast. *
    The húmble shall héar and be glád.

    Glórify the Lórd with mé. *
    Togéther let us práise his náme.
    I sóught the Lórd and he ánswered me; *
    from all my térrors he sét me frée.

    Lóok towards hím and be rádiant; *
    let your fáces nót be abáshed.
    This póor man cálled, the Lord héard him *
    and réscued him from áll his distréss.

    The ángel of the Lórd is encámped *
    around thóse who revére him, to réscue them.
    Taste and sée that the Lórd is góod. *
    He is háppy who seeks réfuge in hím.

    Revére the Lórd, you his sáints. *
    They lack nóthing, thóse who revére him.
    Strong líons suffer wánt and go húngry *
    but thóse who seek the Lórd lack no bléssing.

<p class="ref">Psalm 111 (112)</p>
<psalm>
    Cóme, chíldren, and héar me *
    that I may téach you the féar of the Lórd.
    Who is hé who lóngs for lífe *
    and many dáys, to enjóy his prospérity?

    Then kéep your tóngue from évil *
    and your líps from spéaking decéit.
    Turn asíde from évil and do góod; *
    séek and stríve after péace.

    The Lórd turns his fáce against the wícked *
    to destróy their remémbrance from the éarth.
    The Lórd turns his éyes to the júst *
    and his éars to théir appéal.

    They cáll and the Lórd héars *
    and réscues them in áll their distréss.
    The Lord is clóse to the bróken-héarted; *
    those whose spírit is crúshed he will sáve.

    Mány are the tríals of the júst man *
    but from them áll the Lórd will réscue him.
    He will keep gúard over áll his bónes, *
    not óne of his bónes shall be bróken.

    Évil brings déath to the wícked; *
    those who háte the góod are dóomed.
    The Lord ránsoms the sóuls of his sérvants. *
    Those who híde in him shall nót be condémned.

<psalm>
    We give thanks to you, Lord God Almighty, *
    who are and who were,
    that you have taken your great power *
    and begun to reign.

    The nations raged, *
    but your wrath came,
    and the time for the dead to be judged, *
    for rewarding your servants, the prophets and saints,
    and those who fear your name, *
    both small and great.

    Now the salvation and the power +
    and the kingdom of our God *
    and the authority of his Christ have come,
    for the accuser of our brethren has been thrown down, *
    who accuses them day and night before our God.

    And they have conquered him *
    by the blood of the Lamb
    and by the word of their testimony, *
    for they loved not their lives even unto death.
    Rejoice, then, O heaven, *
    and you that dwell therein.

<p>
    An angel with a golden censer came and stood at the altar. A large quantity of incense was given to him to offer with the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar that stood in front of the throne; and so from the angel’s hand the smoke of the incense went up in the presence of God and with it the prayers of the saints.

<psalm>
    My soul glórifies the Lórd, *
    - my spirit rejóices in Gód, my Sáviour.
    He looks on his sérvant in her lówliness; *
    - henceforth all áges will cáll me bléssed.

    The Almíghty works márvels for me. *
    - Hóly his náme!
    His mércy is from age to áge, *
    - on thóse who féar him.

    He púts forth his árm in stréngth *
    - and scátters the proud-héarted.
    He casts the míghty from their thrónes *
    - and ráises the lówly.

    He fills the stárving with good thíngs, *
    - sends the rích away émpty.

    He protects Ísrael, his sérvant, *
    - remémbering his mércy,
    the mercy prómised to our fáthers, *
    - to Ábraham and his sóns for éver.
