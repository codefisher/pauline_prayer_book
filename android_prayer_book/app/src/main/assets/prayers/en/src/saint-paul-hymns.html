<h1>2.1 Songs in honour of St. Paul the First Hermit
</h1>

<h2>1. Let us sing to our Patriarch</h2>

<psalm>
    Let us sing to our Patriarch,
    let us pay homage to our Father,
    with pure heart and humbled mind,
    united in unison, together.

    Let us direct our steps toward him,
    let us draw our strength from him,
    may the example of his virtue,
    shine forth in our soul’s darkness.

    May we honour Mary,
    In humility, charity and silence,
    May we stand at Jesus’ side,
    and share his triumphant crown.

    O St. Paul who are already in Heaven,
    today, we humbly pray,
    Accept our homage, a sign of our love,
    may we live with you eternally.
</psalm>

<h2>2. O come my thirsting soul for peace</h2>

<psalm>
    O come my thirsting soul for peace,
    come under the foliage palm.
    Rest for a while in its shade,
    after the heated toil, put your head,
    on the stone that closes the cave.

    A gentle breeze of the desert shall cool you,
    and the night’s silence will close your eyes,
    and God’s hand, a mistress of miracles,
    will never depart from you.

    When you get new strength to do your work,
    St. Paul will hold you by your hand,
    and will show you new desert’s paths,
    and will remove from all your fears.

    Life will lead to the only homeland above,
    where there will be sadness or heart’s longing no more,
    now he leads them, his white-dressed sons,
    on the thorny, virtuous way.
</psalm>

<p class="instruction">For the Novices</p>

<psalm>
    May you never loose sight of your goal,
    watch and pray through your Novitiate time,
    many have lost the grace of vocation,
    you may share their fate as well, Dear Brother.

    Therefore, watch for the Lord in solitude,
    follow the example of St. Paul in a cave,
    You will find your happiness from the early morning,
    like your Patron in the desert.
</psalm>

<h2>3. Our Patriarch</h2>

<psalm>
    Our Patriarch, you are an example for all hermits,
    you are the Father of the Pauline Order,
    we honour you in humility,
    and ask you for your help before God’s Throne.

    You have fulfilled all God’s commandments,
    you have despised all earthly pleasures quite early,
    you have overcome all Satan’s snares,
    and have spent many years in the desert.

    God himself made you strong,
    a raven brought you daily bread,
    wild beasts willingly served you,
    for you lived not for this earth, but for heaven.

    May your example encourage us,
    to serve God in your Order, our Father,
    may our vocation grow stronger,
    that we may join you, after we depart
</psalm>

<h2>4. Novitiate Doors</h2>

<psalm>
    How will we find God, in these blessed days?
    Signs are posted on the Novitiate doors.

    The Crucifix, a sign of Passion,
    cries out: Love your Cross,
    for the Cross comes from God’s hand,
    and leads you ever high.

    The Image of Czestochowa’ Lady,
    gently whispers to you:
    Trust your Heavenly Mother,
    She is your Patroness forever.

    The little sanctuary light,
    shines brightly in the night
    and reminds you:
    these are the days filled with God’s grace.

    The black bird with bread in its beak,
    this symbolic raven,
    speaks to you:
    Your real Bread is your Saviour, God himself.

    Therefore, dear brother,
    whenever you gaze your eyes on these doors,
    may your heart be inflamed,
    and may you make a new step in love.
</psalm>
