<h1>Novena to St. Paul the First Hermit</h1>

<p class="instruction">
    Traditionally, we begin the Novena 9 days before the ex-
    ternal solemnity of St. Paul the First Hermit. It is before the next
    Sunday after the 15th of January. The novena to St. Paul the First
    Hermit enjoys a special splendour. It should take place in the
    chapel or at another place, dedicated to St. Paul the First Hermit.
    All members of the community take part in the Novena. The sol-
    emnly professed Monks wear the processional mantle. After the
    solemn entrance to the place of devotion and the placing of the
    relics of our Patriarch, one of the hymns honouring St. Paul the
    First Hermit is sung. The faithful are encouraged to join the sing-
    ing, alternately. It is favourable to sing the hymns with an accom-
    panying music, either organ or trumpet orchestra. A short homily
    should be delivered at the end of the devotion. The veneration of
    the relics takes place, followed by the blessing with the reliquary
    given to the participants according to the Order ritual.

            It was then that Paul the Hermit
            had deprived himself of all,
            of his family, pompous honour,
            and prosperity mortal.

            Not delaying rather fleeting,
            to the den of the desert,
            while his sister had been calling,
            to him that he should revert.

            “Wherever you go or thus move,
            Oh! my brother, I’m moaning,
            Ah! your sister so sincerely,
            as with tears be convincing.

            Don’t leave your paternal home, Paul,
            to be thought inhumanely,
            but I beg you to remain here,
            and wish you to protect me”.

            How your body, Ah,
            So fragile doesn’t belong in the caves,
            nor your talent of great measure,
            hidden in those mountain graves.

            For the people of the Thebaid,
            Desire to acknowledge you,
            so horrendous would this loss be,
            incredible, if it’s true.

            So behold our lover of caves,
            who rejected tears and pleas,
            he was the great self triumpher,
            over sec’lar pageantries.

            As he went on with celerity,
            to the depth of the forest,
            and no knowledge of returning,
            did he wish in this world’s rest.

            Look! What’s so admirable,
            his eremitical face,
            solely walking on this new path,
            never trodden with such grace.

            Not alone in this nude body,
            covered up with some palm leaves,
            for his pleasure fruit was given,
            from Him in Whom he believed.

            Now this hermit who was thirsty,
            thus drank from the flowing in font,
            and so save his life immortal,
            in world’s cares he gave no want.

            All his body how exhausted,
            on the ground he formed his bed,
            oh, this practice sternly followed,
            he endured and with stance led.

            For some sixty years in counting,
            God’s black raven brought repast,
            one half loaf as daily measure,
            bread for keening man’s own fast.

            At the coming of Anthony,
            God so doubled the portion,
            God thus merciful and clement,
            that he cared for their ration.

            Holy Paul said to Anthony,
            “behold him, whom you have sought,
            you look on a man of great age,
            whose repose will soon be brought.

            Now I pray you go and,
            bring me the cloak of Athanasius,
            so to wrap around my body
            and place in the earth precious.

            With the thought of Paul’s transition,
            the old man rushed off distraught,
            then returning all elated,
            he saw Paul’s soul upward brought.

            High among the choirs of heaven,
            this he pondered and conceived,
            Anthony then asked the question,
            “should I rejoice or thus grieve?”

            What grief Anthony encountered,
            from the death of our hermit,
            yet the glory of Paul honoured
            rather placed joy into it.

            All the clothes he took with reverence,
            just before the interment,
            as he chanted with such fervour,
            for the soul which to God went.

            that Saint Paul had merited,
            never had the world admired,
            such an act, experience.

            How two lions did dig the grave,
            for the corpse of the hermit,
            and by which they did reveal him,
            on holiness before men.

            never let us be divided,
            from your own paternal eye.

            Do remember your dear brothers,
            and desert them not on earth,
            but so always interceding,
            bring us to our King, our worth.
