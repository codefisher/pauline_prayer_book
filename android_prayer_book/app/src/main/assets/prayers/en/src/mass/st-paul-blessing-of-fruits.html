<h1 class="index">Solemnity of St. Paul the First Hermit Blessing of Fruits</h1>

<p class="instruction">
    Introduction to the blessing of fruits of the palm:
</p>

<p>
        God makes known his mighty power and his abounding goodness to all the ends of the earth;
        but he also directs his Church to bless the simplest and most commonplace things. He does so
        in order that all who devoutly make use of material things, while invoking St. Paul the
        First Hermit may be drawn to the world that is not seen and may give glory to God, who alone
        performs the wonders we call miracles, but who is wonderful also in his saints.

<div class="prayer-group">
    <prayer red="V." lines="lines"><strong>Let us pray:</strong>
        Lord God, You beautify your Church
        with the rich variety of the virtues of your saints,
        and through the intercession of St. Paul the First Hermit,
        grant that as we eat the fruit of the palm brought here for your blessing,
        we may be eager to imitate St. Paul the First hermit
        whose life we celebrate, and that our reward in heaven
        may be the company of the Blessed Virgin Mary,
        St. Paul the First Hermit and all the Saints,
        whose protection is our comfort on earth.
        Through Christ our Lord.

        Almighty everlasting God, who by your word alone brought into being the heavens, earth, sea,
        things seen and things unseen, and garnished the earth with plants and trees for the use of
        man and beast; who appointed each species to bring forth fruit in its kind, not only for the
        food of living creatures, but for the healing of sick bodies as well; with mind and word we
        urgently call on you in your great kindness, through the intercession of Saint Paul the
        First Hermit to bless <span class="cross">â˜©</span> these fruits of the desert,
        thus increasing their natural powers
        with the newly given grace of your blessing. Through Christ our Lord.
