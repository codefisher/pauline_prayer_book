<h2><span class="rubric">Optional Memorial</span></h2>

<p><em>
    Macarius was born in Alexandria circa AD 300. In his youth, he went to the desert near Thebes,
    where he spent 29 years. Next, he moved to the Scetic Desert, where he gave himself to an even more
    rigorously penitential life. He was then ordained a priest. Living in prayer and fasting, he
    received the gift of prophecy as well the ability to work miracles.

<p>
    As also we remember that a dead man was raised to life by Abbot Macarius who was the first to
    find a home in the desert of Scete. For when a certain heretic who followed the error of
    Eunomius was trying by dialectic subtlety to destroy the simplicity of the Catholic faith, and
    had already deceived a large number of men, the blessed Macarius was asked by some Catholics,
    who were terribly disturbed by the horror of such an upset, to set free the simple folk of all
    Egypt from the peril of infidelity, and came for this purpose. And when the heretic had
    approached him with his dialectic art, and wanted to drag him away in his ignorance to the
    thorns of Aristotle, the blessed Macarius put a stop to his chatter with apostolic brevity,
    saying: &ldquo;the kingdom of God is not in word but in power.&rdquo; (1 Corinthians 4:20) Let us go therefore
    to the tombs, and let us invoke the name of the Lord over the first dead man we find, and let
    us, as it is written, &ldquo;show our faith by our works,&rdquo; (James 2:14) that by His testimony the manifest
    proofs of a right faith may be shown, and we may prove the clear truth not by an empty
    discussion of words but by the power of miracles and that judgment which cannot be deceived. And
    when he heard this the heretic &hellip; fled away, and at once escaped out of all Egypt.
</p>

<p>
    When then the blessed Macarius had taken up his position by a most ancient corpse, he said &ldquo;O
    man, if that heretic and son of perdition had come hither with me, and, while he was standing
    by, I had exclaimed and invoked the name of Christ my God, say in the presence of these who were
    almost perverted by his fraud, whether you would have arisen.&rdquo; Then he arose and replied with
    words of assent. And then Abbot Macarius asked him what he had formerly been when he enjoyed
    life here, or in what age of men he had lived, or if he had then known the name of Christ, and
    he replied that he had lived under kings of most ancient date, and declared that in those days
    he had never heard the name of Christ. To whom once more Abbot Macarius: &ldquo;Sleep,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;in
    peace with the others in your own order, to be roused again by Christ in the end.&rdquo; All this power
    then and grace of his which was in him would perhaps have always been hidden, unless the needs
    of the whole province which was endangered, and his entire devotion to Christ, and unfeigned
    love, had forced him to perform this miracle.
