<h1>7. An act of Expiation to the Immaculate Heart of Mary</h1>

<p>
    O Immaculate Heart of Mary, masterpiece of Almighty
    God, most honoured vessel of the Most Holy Trinity; it is our
    greatest joy to venerate and honour you. You have loved us so
    much! After God, we owe everything to you! You gave us your
    beloved Son, Jesus. For our sake, you shared all his sufferings.
    Your suffering was “as deep as the sea”. But, there are some un-
    happy souls, who instead of loving you without end, inspired by
    the devil himself, dare to throw at your Name and your most ex-
    alted privileges, their hideous blasphemies.
</p>

<p>
    Every day, millions of Christians through their sins, renew
    the passion of Christ and pierce your Immaculate Heart. Unfortu-
    nately, we, ourselves, through our faults, do the same. Forgive us,
    O Queen and Mother of Mercy all our infidelities toward you. To-
    day, more than ever before, we promise with the help of God’s
    grace to honour, to love and imitate you. In the spirit of expiation,
    we renew our total consecration to you.
</p>

<p>
    We offer you all what we are and possess. We want to be
    true to this consecration by the way we live, by working for an
    increase of your glory and the kingship of your Son.
</p>

<p>
    For all the blasphemies and insults
    directed against you by words and deeds,
    &mdash; we expiate to your heart, O Mary.
</p>

<p>
    For the profanations of you holy images,
    &mdash; we expiate to your heart, O Mary.
</p>

<p>
    For outrages and ingratitude with which
    we have wounded your Maternal heart
    &mdash; we expiate to your heart, O Mary.
</p>

<p>
    For the ignorance and indifference of many Christians,
    &mdash; we expiate to your heart, O Mary.
</p>

<p>
    United with all Angels, Saints and chosen souls
    we honour you in heaven and on earth,
    &mdash; we expiate to your heart, O Mary.
</p>

<p>
    Accept our filial homage. Show yourself to be our Mother and
    make us worthy to be numbered among your servants and children.
    Amen.
