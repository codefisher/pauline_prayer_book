<h1 class="index"><span class="rubric">Monday after Pentecost</span> <br />Mary, Mother of the Church</h1>

<h2><span class="rubric">Feast</span></h2>

<p><em>
    &ldquo;By reason of the gift and role of divine maternity, by which she is united with her Son, the Redeemer, and with His singular graces and functions, the Blessed Virgin is also intimately united with the Church. As St. Ambrose taught, the Mother of God is a type of the Church in the order of faith, charity and perfect union with Christ.&rdquo; (Lumen Gentium 63)
</em></p>

<h2 class="rubric">Entrance Antiphon <span class="ref">Cf. Acts 1:14</span></h2>
<litany>
    The disciples devoted themselves with one accord to prayer with Mary, the Mother of Jesus.

<h2 class="rubric">Collect</h2>
<litany>O God, Father of mercies,
    whose Only Begotten Son, as he hung upon the Cross,
    chose the Blessed Virgin Mary, his Mother,
    to be our mother also,
    grant, we pray, that with her loving help
    your Church may be more fruitful day by day
    and, exulting in the holiness of her children,
    may draw to her embrace all the families of the peoples.
    Through our lord Jesus Christ, your son,
    who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the holy spirit,
    one God, for ever and ever.

<h2 class="rubric">Prayer over the Offerings</h2>
<litany>Receive our offerings, O Lord,
    and transform them into the mystery of salvation,
    so that by its power we may be set aflame
    with the charity of the Virgin Mary, Mother of the Church,
    and with her may be united more closely
    to the work of redemption.
    Through Christ our lord.

        <sp>V/</sp> The Lord be with you.<br />
        <sp>R/</sp> And with your spirit.
    </p>

    <p class="noindent">
        <sp>V/</sp> Lift up your hearts.<br />
        <sp>R/</sp> We lift them up to the Lord.

    <p class="noindent">
        <sp>V/</sp> Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.<br />
        <sp>R/</sp> It is right and just.
    </p>

    <litany includeblank="includeblank" class="strong">
        It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,
        always and everywhere to give you thanks,
        Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God,
        and to proclaim your greatness with due praise,
        as we honor the Blessed Virgin Mary.

        Receiving your Word in her immaculate heart,
        she was found worthy to conceive him in her virgin’s womb
        and, giving birth to the Creator,
        she nurtured the beginnings of the Church.

        Standing beside the Cross,
        she received the testament of divine love
        and took to herself as sons and daughters
        all those who by the Death of Christ
        are born to heavenly life.

        As the Apostles awaited the Apirit you had promised,
        she joined her supplication to the prayers of the disciples
        and so became the pattern of the Church at prayer.

        Raised to the glory of heaven,
        she accompanies your pilgrim Church with a mother’s love
        and watches in kindness over the Church’s homeward steps,
        until the lord’s Day shall come in glorious splendor.

        And so, with all the Angels and Saints,
        we praise you, as without end we acclaim:

        Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts&hellip;

    Having received the pledge of redemption and of life,
    we humbly pray, O Lord,
    that, with the Blessed Virgin’s motherly help,
    your Church may teach all nations

    and, through the grace of the outpouring of the spirit,
    fill the whole earth.
    Through Christ our lord.
