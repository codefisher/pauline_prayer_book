<p class="rubric" number="21.">
    When all this has been done, the Offertory Chant begins. Meanwhile, the ministers place the corporal, the purificator, the chalice, the pall, and the Missal on the altar.
</p>

<p class="rubric" number="22.">
    It is desirable that the faithful express their participation by making an offering, bringing forward bread and wine for the celebration of the Eucharist and perhaps other gifts to relieve the needs of the Church and of the poor.
</p>

<p class="rubric" number="23.">
    The Priest, standing at the altar, takes the paten with the bread and holds it slightly raised above the altar with both hands, saying in a low voice:
</p>

<litany>
    Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation,
    for through your goodness we have received
    the bread we offer you:
    fruit of the earth and work of human hands,
    it will become for us the bread of life.
</litany>

<p class="rubric">
    Then he places the paten with the bread on the corporal.
</p>

<p class="rubric">
    If, however, the Offertory Chant is not sung, the Priest may speak these words aloud; at the end, the people may acclaim:
</p>

<p class="noindent">
    Blessed be God for ever.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
    24. <span class="rubric">The Deacon, or the Priest, pours wine and a little water into the chalice, saying
    quietly:</span>
</p>

<litany>
    By the mystery of this water and wine
    may we come to share in the divinity of Christ
    who humbled himself to share in our humanity.
</litany>

<p class="rubric" number="24.">
    The Priest then takes the chalice and holds it slightly raised above the altar with both hands, saying in a low voice:
</p>

<litany>
    Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation,
    for through your goodness we have received
    the wine we offer you:
    fruit of the vine and work of human hands,
    it will become our spiritual drink.
</litany>

<p class="noindent">
    Then he places the chalice on the corporal.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
    If, however, the Offertory Chant is not sung, the Priest may speak these words aloud; at the end, the people may acclaim:
</p>

<p class="noindent">
    Blessed be God for ever.
</p>

<p class="rubric" number="26.">
    After this, the Priest, bowing profoundly, says quietly:
</p>

<litany>
    With humble spirit and contrite heart
    may we be accepted by you, O Lord,
    and may our sacrifice in your sight this day
    be pleasing to you, Lord God.
</litany>

<p class="rubric" number="27.">
    If appropriate, he also incenses the offerings, the cross, and the altar. A Deacon or other minister then incenses the Priest and the people.
</p>

<p class="rubric" number="28.">
    Then the Priest, standing at the side of the altar, washes his hands, saying quietly:
</p>

<litany>
    Wash me, O Lord, from my iniquity
    and cleanse me from my sin.
</litany>

<p class="noindent">
    29. <span class="rubric">Standing at the middle of the altar, facing the people, extending and then joining
    his hands, he says:</span>
</p>

<player>mass/pray-brethren</player>

<litany>
    Pray, brethren <span class="rubric">(</span>brothers and sisters<span class="rubric">)</span>,
    that my sacrifice and yours
    may be acceptable to God,
    the almighty Father.
</litany>

<p class="rubric">
The people rise and reply:
</p>

<player>mass/lord-accept</player>

<litany>
    May the Lord accept the sacrifice at your hands
    for the praise and glory of his name,
    for our good
    and the good of all his holy Church.
</litany>

<p class="rubric" number="30.">
    Then the Priest, with hands extended, says the Prayer over the Offerings, at the end of which the people acclaim:
</p>

<p class="noindent">
    Amen.
</p>

<h1 class="section">The Eucharistic Prayer</h1>

<p class="rubric" number="31.">
    Then the Priest begins the Eucharistic Prayer.
</p>

<player>mass/eucharist-greeting</player>

<p class="rubric">
Extending his hands, he says:
</p>

<litany class="strong">
The Lord be with you.
</litany>

<p class="rubric">
The people reply:
</p>

<p class="noindent">
And with your spirit.
</p>

<p class="rubric">
The Priest, raising his hands, continues:
</p>

<litany class="strong">
Lift up your hearts.
</litany>

<p class="rubric">
The people:
</p>

<p class="noindent">
We lift them up to the Lord.
</p>

<p class="rubric">
The Priest, with hands extended, adds:
</p>

<litany class="strong">
Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.
</litany>

<p class="rubric">
    The people:
</p>

<p class="noindent">
It is right and just.
</p>

<p class="rubric">
The Priest, with hands extended, continues the Preface.
</p>

<p class="rubric">
At the end of the Preface he joins his hands and concludes the Preface with the people, singing or saying aloud:
</p>

<player>mass/holy-holy-holy</player>

<litany class="strong">
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
Heaven and earth are full of your glory.
Hosanna in the highest.
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
Hosanna in the highest.
</litany>

<p class="rubric">Or:</p>

<player>mass/sanctus-sanctus-sanctus</player>

<p class="rubric" number="32.">
