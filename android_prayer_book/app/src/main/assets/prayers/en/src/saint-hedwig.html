<h1>4. Saint Hedwig</h1>

<p class="instruction">
    St. Hedwig, Queen of Poland (1374 - 1399). During the
    Canonization Mass, June 8, 1997 on the Great Meadows of Cra-
    cow, Pope John Paul II in his homily, said the following, “It was
    from the Black Crucifix, venerated at the royal Cathedral of Wawel
    that St. Hedwig learned her deep wisdom and love for the poor and
    suffering. It was from the contemplation of that famed Cross and
    her personal union with the Crucified Lord that she never lost the
    “best part” (cf. Lk 10: 42), the presence of Christ. Today, we wish
    to kneel with you, St. Hedwig, at the foot of that Cross of Wawel, to be
    able to hear an echo of that divine lesson you once heard. From
    you, St. Hedwig, we want to learn how to realize this divine lesson in
    our days.”

<p class="instruction">
    St. Hedwig is very close to our Pauline Order for many
    reasons because of the historical ties between Poland and Hun-
    gary. Her father, Louis the Angevin was a great benefactor and
    supporter of the Pauline Order in Hungry and in Poland through
    his deputy, the Prince Ladislaus of Opole, who according to tradi-
    tion, brought the miraculous image of Our Lady of Czestochowa to
    Poland in 1383 and entrusted it to the Pauline Monks, invited from
    the Hungarian Monastery Maria Nostra. We are in possession of
    a document issued on February 24, 1393 and signed by the King
    Ladisalus Jagiello, the King of Poland and husband of St. Hedwig,
    who confirmed the foundation of the Monastery of Jasna Gora,
    initiated by Prince Laislaus of Opole. It is most probable that the
    King was greatly influenced by his saintly wife, St. Hedwig, to make
    such a decision. Her mission was one of personal sacrifice to
    bring the nations to the Catholic Church. As a young lady, she was
    chosen as Queen of Poland by the Polish nobles. She fulfilled her
    mission of personal sacrifice when she broke her engagement with
    Wilhelm Habsburg, and married a much older and wild Duke of
    Lithuania, Ladislaus Jagiello, the future King of Poland, in order
    to bring him and all the Lithuanians to the Catholic Faith. Thus,
    she became the “godmother” of Catholic Lithuania and began a
    mission of evangelization. With her great heart and wisdom she
    embraced all her subjects with love, especially the poor and under-
    privileged. She gave away much of her personal treasures to found
    the Jagiellonian University in Kraków, one of the best universities
    in Europe to this day.

<p class="instruction">
    The life of St. Hedwig is deeply associated with the mys-
    tery of the Cross. It serves the Pauline Order as an eminent re-
    minder of its mission of the Cross. The first Monastery of the Pau-
    lines in Hungary was founded under the sign of the Holy Cross. In
    Kraków the Pauline Monastery on the “Skałka” (a little rock) is a
    short distance from Wawel Castle. In both places, the mystery
    of the Cross remains an object of deep contemplation and a source
    of spiritual strength. St. Hedwig gives us a shining example of that
    special love of the Holy Cross.

<h2>6.2 Prayer to St. Hedwig the Queen</h2>

<p class="indent">
    Our Beloved Queen Hedwig, you have made a great per-
    sonal sacrifice in order to bring many souls to salvation and have
    become the Apostle of Lithuania. You propagated the Catholic
    Faith and built churches of divine worship. You dried up many
    tears of sorrows during your life here on earth and hereafter. Many
    sick recovered their health through your care and prayer. You
    ruled your subjects with goodness, meekness and mercy.
</p>

<p class="indent">
    Therefore, we ask you today to protect and defend all
    families and particularly our religious family from all dissensions
    and troubles. Pray for the conversion of poor sinners and implore
    for them the grace of eternal salvation.
</p>

<p class="indent">
    We trust in you, our Queen Hedwig and we hope that you
    will never fail us. As in the past, your spirit intercedes to God for
    us today. In heaven you contemplate the glorified face of Jesus.
    Pray to him on our behalf and tell him, “Lord who will return their
    tears?” The Lord will listen to you now as He once listened to you
    in the Wawel Cathedral. In your compassion, look down on your
    people, often discouraged and oppressed. Bring them health of
    body and consolation of the spirit. For all your favours bestowed
    upon them, they will bless you forever. St. Hedwig, pray for us!
