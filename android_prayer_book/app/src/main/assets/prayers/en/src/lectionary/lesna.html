    A reading from the prophet Zacharia
</reading>

<p>
    Sing, rejoice, daughter of Zion; for I am coming to dwell in the middle of you, it is Lord who speaks.
    Many nations will join Yahweh, on that day; they will become his people. But he will remain among you, and you will know that Lord Sabaoth has sent me to you.
    But Yahweh will hold Judah as his portion in the Holy Land, and again make Jerusalem his very own.
    Let all mankind be silent before Yahweh! For he is awaking and is coming from his holy dwelling.

    The Word of the Lord.

    <psalm>
        My soul glorifies the Lord,
        - my spirit rejoices in God, my Saviour.
        He looks on his servant in her lowliness;
        - henceforth all ages will call me blessed.&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>

        The Almighty works marvels for me.
        - Holy his name!
        His mercy is from age to age,
        - on those who fear him.&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>

        He puts forth his arm in strength
        - and scatters the proud-hearted.
        He casts the mighty from their thrones
        - and raises the lowly.
        He fills the starving with good things,
        - sends the rich away empty.&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>

        He protects Israel, his servant,
        - remembering his mercy,
        the mercy promised to our fathers,
        - to Abraham and his sons for ever.&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>

<reading label="Second Reading" ref="4:4-7" tagline="God sent his Son, born of a woman">A Reading from the letter of St. Paul to the Galatians
</reading>

<p>
    When the appointed time came, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born a subject of the Law, to
    redeem the subjects of the Law and to enable us to be adopted as sons. The proof that you are
    sons is that God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts: the Spirit that cries, ‘Abba,
    Father’, and it is this that makes you a son, you are not a slave any more; and if God has made
    you son, then he has made you heir.
</p>

<p>
    The Word of the Lord.

    <span class="cross">☩</span> A reading from the holy Gospel according to  Luke
</reading>

<p>
    Mary set out and went as quickly as she could to a town in the hill country of Judah. She went into Zechariah’s house and greeted Elizabeth. Now as soon as Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the child leapt in her womb and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. She gave a loud cry and said, ‘Of all women you are the most blessed, and blessed is the fruit of your womb. Why should I be honoured with a visit from the mother of my Lord? For the moment your greeting reached my ears, the child in my womb leapt for joy. Yes, blessed is she who believed that the promise made her by the Lord would be fulfilled.’
</p>
<p>
    Mary said:
</p>

<litany>
    ‘My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord
    and my spirit exults in God my saviour;
