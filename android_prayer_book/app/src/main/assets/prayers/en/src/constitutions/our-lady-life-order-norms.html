<h1 class="index">Chapter VI: Our Lady in the Life of the Order</h1>


<h2 id="norm63">Norm 63</h2>

<p>
    The spirituality and Apostolic work of our Order is characterised by a singular devotion to the
    Mother of God. As a result, we should stress the role of Mary in the Mystery of the Church
    making every effort to cultivate special devotion to her in various forms, especially those
    forms which are proper to the local Church.
</p>

<h2 id="norm64">Norm 64</h2>

<p>
    We observe all the Marian feast days especially the following:
</p>

<ol class="alph">
    <li> Solemnity of Mary, the Mother of God - January 1<sup>st</sup>;</li>
    <li> The feast of Mary, Queen of Hermits, Mother and Protectress of the Order – January
        16<sup>th</sup>;</li>
    <li> The Annunciation of the Lord – March 25<sup>th</sup> ;</li>
    <li> The feast of Mary, Mother of the Church – Monday following Pentecost;</li>
    <li> The solemnity of the Assumption of the Mother of God – August 15<sup>th</sup>;</li>
    <li> The solemnity of the Mother of God of Jasna Gora – August 26<sup>th</sup>;</li>
    <li> The solemnity of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary, special Patroness of
        all Pauline Youth – December 8<sup>th</sup>;
    </li>
    <li> All Marian feasts celebrated in the local shrines of our Order.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="norm65">Norm 65</h2>

<p>
    Our Marian apostolate also expresses itself through the cultivation of:
</p>

<ol class="alph">
    <li> The devotion of the Saturdays honouring the Queen of Poland (in Poland);</li>
    <li> The first Saturdays of the month;</li>
    <li> The devotion of the Rorate Mass (Dawn Mass of Our Lady) during Advent;</li>
    <li> May and October devotions; (Exposition, Rosary and Sung Litany of Loreto)</li>
    <li> In Churches of the Order and especially in our Shrines the daily recitation of the
        Rosary;
    </li>
    <li> The singing of the Little Hours (Godzinki) in honour of the Immaculate Conception of Our
        Lady and the daily Apel Jasnogorski (Maria Regina Mundi, a short meditation, and a decade of
        the Rosary) in all our Churches and chapels;
    </li>
    <li> Besides this in all our monasteries in addition to the daily Apel we should continue the
        tradition of singing the litany of Loreto according to the he Jasna Gora melody. At Jasna
        Gora we observe on certain Marian feast days according to our tradition the devotion called
        “Kleczki” (The kneeling Prayers);
    </li>
    <li> It is important to remind all pilgrims coming to Jasna Gora not only of the national vows
        made at Jasna Gora but also the act of surrendering Poland into the maternal hands of Mary
        during the Millennium as well as the Jubilee consecration of the Holy Father, John Paul II,
        but also the union of Mary with the Church itself as well as our nation and to stress the
        consequences and the obligations flowing from these acts of devotion.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="norm66">Norm 66</h2>

<p>
    In order to cultivate a Marian spirit in our Monastic Families we observe the following
    practices:
</p>

<ol class="alph">
    <li> On the feast of the Queen of Hermits, Mother and Protectress of the Order observed on
        January 16<sup>th</sup>, each Community renews its consecration to Mary. As part of this
        consecration we offer first thanks, we place ourselves totally at her disposal in our
        further action with her for the good of the Church and we beg her protection for ourselves;
    </li>
    <li> We recite daily the morning antiphon “Rejoice O Mother of God” besides praying the
        Angelus;
    </li>
    <li> We honour Mary each day by reciting at least one portion of the holy rosary and praying the
        litany of Loreto;
    </li>
    <li> We should frequently renew our act of surrender to the Mother of God and make every effort
        to develop a more perfect devotion to her;
    </li>
    <li> We should take care to deepen our devotion to the Mother of God and further our Marian
        apostolate, which is so organically connected with such a devotion by studying the documents
        of the Church and reading suitable books and periodicals. The Library specialising in
        Mariology, which is found at Jasna Gora can be most helpful in serving this purpose.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="norm67">Norm 67</h2>

<p>
    The Marian Shrine at Jasna Gora in Częstochowa serves the Pauline Religious Family as the
    principal centre of activity and is a most significant sign of its calling and mission to
    others. Each Community when called upon to do so by the governing body of Jasna Gora should be
    most eager to help the Community there in its Pastoral duties.
</p>


<h2 id="norm68">Norm 68</h2>

<p>
    Aware of the Marian mission of our Order as well as of the exceptional role of Jasna Gora in the
    Religious Life of the Polish nation for whom Mary is a “wonderful help and defense” the Father
    General of our Order must place the good of the Shrine at Jasna Gora among the first and most
    important of his concerns and obligations.
</p>


<h2 id="norm69">Norm 69</h2>

<p>
    The Prior of Jasna Gora who is entrusted with caring for this priceless shrine of our Order
    should be a person characterized by a singular appreciation for its mission as well as being
    familiar with the real problems connected with Marian pastoral activity. He should also be one
    who has the ability to coordinate such activity.
</p>

<p>
    He should be concerned not only with the fair
    distribution of various obligations but also with the quality of Pastoral Activity but in a
    special way he should be concerned for the good of the members of the Community as they work
    together. He also is a member of the Pastoral Council of the Order.
</p>


<h2 id="norm70">Norm 70</h2>

<p>
    The Community at Jasna Gora should consider it a great privilege to be called to work together
    in a special way with Mary, Mother of the Church and Mother of the Order. The members of this
    community must be aware especially that their generous dedication in fulfilling their obligation
    as well as by their spirit and attitude they have an enormously important effect on the
    Apostolic work of the entire Order and on the opinion which it enjoys in society.
</p>

<h2 id="norm71">Norm 71</h2>

<p>
    It is also important that in those other Churches of ours especially shrines where there are
    either images or paintings that have been crowned care be taken to develop the cult and devotion
    which is proper to those Marian centres.
</p>
<p>
    We must take care to spread devotion to the Mother of God especially under her title of Jasna
    Gora in our newly established monasteries and Pastoral centres.
