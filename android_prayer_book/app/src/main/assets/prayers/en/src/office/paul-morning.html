<h2>Morning Prayer</h2>

<reading label="Hymn"></reading>

<psalm>
    We sing to Paul the first hermit,
    great honour of our Order.
    The caves, and woods, and deserts
    filling with the divine presence.

    You, not fearing the devil’s witchcrafts,
    you, not minding the rock’s harshness,
    nor the wilderness of far lands,
    nor with drawing your resolution.

    You, whom a black raven nourished
    and a small spring the thirst quenched;
    Whom a large palm’s leafage covered,
    and a couch the soil provided.

    You, whose mind kept always soaring,
    far from world contamination.
    You, who joined the crowds of angels,
    that are known to God the Mighty.

    Turn your glance and hear the prayers,
    blessed Father, Blessed Paul,
    grant us lives afar from foulness,
    grant its mantles of the heavens.

    Be glory to the Father,
    and to the Son and Spirit,
    be glory to the Trinity,
    for ages without end. Amen.
</psalm>

    My sóul shall be fílled as with a bánquet, *

    On my béd I remémber yóu. *
    - On yóu I múse through the níght

    I can assure you my brothers, I am far from thinking that I have already won. All I can say is
    that I  forget the past and I strain ahead for what is still to come; I am racing for the finish,
    for the prize to which God calls us upwards to receive in Christ Jesus.
