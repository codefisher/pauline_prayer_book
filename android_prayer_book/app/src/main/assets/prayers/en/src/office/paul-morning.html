<h2>Morning Prayer</h2>

<reading label="Hymn"></reading>

<psalm>
    We sing to Paul first hermit,
    Great honour of our Order.
    The caves, and woods, and deserts
    Filling with divine presence

    You, not fearing devil’s witchcrafts,
    You, not minding the rock’s harshness,
    Nor the wilderness of far lands,
    Nor with drawing your resolution.

    You, whom a black raven nourished
    And a small spring the thirst quenched
    Whom a large palm’s leafage covered
    And a couch the sole provided.

    You, whose mind kept always soaring,
    Far from world contamination.
    You, who joined the crowds of angels,
    That are known to God the Mighty.

    Turn your glance and hear the prayers
    Blessed Father, Blessed Paul,
    Grant us lives afar from foulness
    Grant its mantles of the heavens

    Be glory to Father
    And to the Son and Spirit
    Be glory to the Trinity
    For ages without end. Amen
</psalm>

<p class="ref">Psalm 62 (63)</p>
<psalm>
    O God, you are my God, for you I long; *
    - for you my soul is thirsting.
    My body pines for you *
    - like a dry, weary land without water.

    So I gaze on you in the sanctuary *
    - to see your strength and your glory.
    For your love is better than life, *
    - my lips will speak your praise.

    So I will bless you all my life, *
    - in your name I will lift up my hands.
    My soul shall be filled as with a banquet, *
    - my mouth shall praise you with joy.

    On my bed I remember you. *
    - On you I muse through the night
    for you have been my help; *
    - in the shadow of your wings I rejoice.
    My soul clings to you; *
    - your right hand holds me fast.

    Sing a new song to the Lord, *

    Let Israel rejoice in its Maker, *
    - let Zion’s sons exult in their king.
    Let them praise his name with dancing *
    - and make music with timbrel and harp.

    For the Lord takes delight in his people. *
    - He crowns the poor with salvation.
    Let the faithful rejoice in their glory, *
    - shout for joy and take their rest.
    Let the praise of God be on their lips *
    - and a two-edged sword in their hand,

    to deal out vengeance to the nations *
    - and punishment on all the peoples;
    to bind their kings in chains *
    - and their nobles in fetters of iron;
    to carry out the sentence pre-ordained: *
    - this honour is for all his faithful.

<p>
    I can assure you my brothers, I am far from thinking that I have already won. All I can say is
    that I  forget the past and I strain ahead for what is still to come; I am racing for the finish,
    for the prize to which God call us upwards to receive in Christ Jesus.

<psalm>
    Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel! *
    - He has visited his people and redeemed them.

    He has raised up for us a mighty saviour *
    - in the house of David his servant,
    as he promised by the lips of holy men, *
    - those who were his prophets from of old.

    A saviour who would free us from our foes, *
    - from the hands of all who hate us.
    So his love for our fathers is fulfilled *
    - and his holy covenant remembered.

    He swore to Abraham our father to grant us, *
    - that free from fear, and saved from the hands of our foes,
    we might serve him in holiness and justice *
    - all the days of our life in his presence.

    As for you, little child, *
    - you shall be called a prophet of God, the Most High.
    You shall go ahead of the Lord *
    - to prepare his ways before him,

    To make known to his people their salvation *
    - through forgiveness of all their sins,
    the loving-kindness of the heart of our God *
    - who visits us like the dawn from on high.

    He will give light to those in darkness, +
    - those who dwell in the shadow of death, *
    - and guide us into the way of peace.
