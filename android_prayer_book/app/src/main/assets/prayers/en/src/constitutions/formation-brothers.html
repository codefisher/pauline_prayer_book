<h1 class="index">Chapter V: The Formation of Brothers</h1>


<h2 id="art96">Article 96</h2>

<p>
    Religious Profession is the basis for Brotherhood in the Pauline Community taking into account
    different charisma and forms of service. Formation, which is based on this reality, embraces the
    whole personality of the Brother who through Baptism and Monastic Consecration has become joined
    in a special manner with the life and Ministry of the Church, thereby, making him, Apostle, and
    Witness of Christ among the people.
</p>


<h2 id="art97">Article 97</h2>

<p>
    In the period of formation, preceding Perpetual Profession the Major Superior assigns a Director
    for the Brothers to assist them in developing a monastic life. Superiors and directors must
    assure the Brothers a total and full religious formation helping them gain religious knowledge,
    taking into account their spiritual needs as well as their individual obligations within our
    Pauline Community. Special care should be taken that the Brothers especially completing
    Novitiate should find suitable means for their education.
</p>


<h2 id="art98">Article 98</h2>

<p>
    Modelling themselves on the example given by Christ, His Mother and St. Joseph in Nazareth, let
    the Brothers imitate their life which was filled with quiet hardship. Thus let them sanctify
    their dedicated work.
</p>
<p>
    Our Brothers are concerned with work around our Houses, in the fields of farming and trades as
    well as in administrative functions, according to their preparation and the needs of the House.
    Let them be mindful that every kind of work, when joined with prayer, thanks to Religious
    Profession, has the power to transform their life into an Apostolate and assists the Church in
    its work of saving the world.
</p>


<h2 id="art99">Article 99</h2>

<p>
    The formation of Brothers during the period of temporary profession has as its goal leading them
    to the decision to become joined forever with Christ in our Order through Solemn Perpetual
    Profession. Before the taking of Solemn Vows an appropriate period of time should be set aside
    to prepare for so serious an action.
</p>
<p>
    All those in Solemn Profession, living in houses in which the Brother about to be professed has
    lived for some time, should give a consultative vote in secret prior to his admission to Solemn
    Profession.
</p>


<h2 id="art100">Article 100</h2>

<p>
    Superiors must take care that the Brothers acquire skills proper to their trades as well as
    proper level of cultural training. This is indispensable in order that they might come to
    demonstrate the values proper to the Pauline Community and accept responsibility for them. The
    Superiors should take care to single out those who possess certain talents and appreciation for
    the monastic spirit making it possible for them to become better qualified in various field
    according to the needs of the Order.
