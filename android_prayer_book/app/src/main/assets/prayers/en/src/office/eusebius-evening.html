<h2>Evening Prayer</h2>

<reading label="Hymn"></reading>

<psalm>
    Deep in the vast wilderness
    A flame illuminates the darkness;
    Bright prayer rises
    Of saintly Eusebius' hermits.

    O Eusebius, our Father,
    Astonished as we are with delight,
    Favored as you are by God,
    Gather your people as one.

    Deep in the vast wilderness
    Bright flames are deeply hidden.
    By lives led for the glory of God,
    And in praise of the Blessed Virgin Mary.

    O Eusebius, our Father,
    Astonished as we are with delight,
    Favored as you are by God,
    Father your people as one.

    Deep in our own lowly souls,
    May flames grow always anew,
    In praise of the Father and Son,
    And Holy Spirit forever.

    O Eusebius, our Father,
    Astonished as we are with delight,
    Favored as you are by God,
    Gather your people as one.
    Amen.

    + Lord, whó shall be admítted to your tént *

    Such a mán will stand fírm for éver.

    Happy the mán who féars the Lórd, *

    - his jústice stands fírm for éver.
    He is a líght in the dárkness for the úpright: *
    - he is génerous, mérciful and júst.

    The góod man takes píty and lénds, *
    - he condúcts his affáirs with hónour.
    The júst man will néver wáver: *

<p>
    Over all these clothes, to keep them together and complete them, put on love. And may the
    peace of Christ reign in your hearts, because it is for this that you were called together
    as parts of one body. Always be thankful. Let the message of Christ, in all its richness,
    find a home with you. Teach each other, and advise each other in all wisdom. With gratitude
    in your hearts sing psalms and hymns and inspired songs to God.

    God, after whom all fatherhood is named in heaven and on earth, chose Blessed Eusebius of Esztergom to consecrate his life to him in solitude and there with his brother hermits to love God and his neighbour.  Let us pray to him with humble heart: <br />  <sp>R/</sp> <em>Lord, save your people.</em>
    Help us to reject everything that is opposed to the name of Christ;
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span> so that we may imitate you with a sincere heart.&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>
    Accept us as a holy, living sacrifice, pleasing to you;
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span> so that with renewed minds we may together learn what is good and pleasing to you.&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>
    Grant that we may be clothed with kindness, gentleness and forbearance;
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span> and, supporting one another in turn, we may have charity towards all.&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>
    Turn our eyes towards the rock from which we have been carved;
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span> so that we may all faithfully pursue our calling according to the example of our fathers Saint Paul, the First Hermit, and Blessed Eusebius.&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>
    Grant that together with all the Saints of the Pauline Order;
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span> we may contemplate you in heaven without end.&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>

<litany>
    O God, who called Blessed Eusebius
    into the wilderness of Pilis out of his love for you,
    that there he might offer his life in propitiation for the people
    and gather the scattered hermits,
    grant, we beseech you, that through his life and intercession
    our order may be made one in faith and love.
    Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
    who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
    one God, for ever and ever.
