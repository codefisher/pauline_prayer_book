    <span class="rubric">Ant. 1:</span> Lord who shall be admitted to your tent? <sp>+</sp>
</p>
<p class="ref">Psalm 14 (15)</p>
<psalm>
    + Lord, who shall be admitted to your tent *
    - and dwell on your holy mountain?

    He who walks without fault; *
    - he who acts with justice
    and speaks the truth from his heart; *
    - he who does not slander with his tongue;

    he who does no wrong to his brother, *
    - who casts no slur on his neighbour,
    who holds the godless in disdain, *
    - but honours those who fear the Lord;

    he who keeps his pledge, come what may; +
    - who takes no interest on a loan *
    - and accepts no bribes against the innocent.
    Such a man will stand firm forever.
</psalm>

    <span class="rubric">Ant. 2:</span> That you may tell the next generation that such is our God, our God for ever and always.  It is he who leads us.

<p class="ref">Psalm 111 (112)</p>
<psalm>
    Happy the man who fears the Lord, *
    - who takes delight in all his commands.
    His sons will be powerful on earth; *
    - the children of the upright are blessed.

    Riches and wealth are in his house; *
    - his justice stands firm for ever.
    He is a light in the darkness for the upright: *
    - he is generous, merciful and just.

    The good man takes pity and lends, *
    - he conducts his affairs with honour.
    The just man will never waver: *
    - he will be remembered for ever.

    He has no fear of evil news; *
    - with a firm heart he trusts in the Lord.
    With a steadfast heart he will not fear; *
    - he will see the downfall of his foes.

    Open-handed, he gives to the poor; +
    - his justice stands firm for ever. *
    - His head will be raised in glory.

    The wicked man sees and is angry, +
    - grinds his teeth and fades away; *
    - the desire of the wicked leads to doom.

<psalm>
    Great and wonderful are your deeds, *
    - O Lord God the Almighty!
    Just and true are your ways, *
    - O King of the ages!

    Who shall not fear and glorify your name, O Lord? *
    - For you alone are holy.
    All nations shall come and worship you, *
    - for your judgements have been revealed.

    Over all these clothes, to keep them together and complete them, put on love. And may the
    peace of Christ reign in your hearts, because it is for this that you were called together
    as parts of one body. Always be thankful. Let the message of Christ, in all its richness,
    find a home with you. Teach each other, and advise each other in all wisdom. With gratitude
    in your hearts sing psalms and hymns and inspired songs to God.

<psalm>
    My soul glorifies the Lord, *
    - my spirit rejoices in God, my Saviour.
    He looks on his servant in her lowliness; *
    - henceforth all ages will call me blessed.

    The Almighty works marvels for me. *
    - Holy his name!
    His mercy is from age to age, *
    - on those who fear him.

    He puts forth his arm in strength *
    - and scatters the proud hearted.
    He casts the mighty from their thrones *
    - and raises the lowly.

    He fills the starving with good things, *
    - send the rich away empty.

    He protects Israel, his servant, *
    - remembering his mercy,
    the mercy promised to our fathers, *
    - to Abraham and his sons forever.

    God, who from all paternity in heaven and on earth calls by name, chose Blessed Eusebius of Esztergom that he might consecrate his life to Him in solitude and there with his brother hermits loved God and neighbour. <br />  <sp>R/</sp> <em>Lord, save your people.</em>
    Help us to reject everything, that is against the name christian,
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span> that we might imitate you with a sincere heart. <sp>R/</sp>
    Accept us as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to you,
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span> that with a renewal of mind we might always learn what is good and pleasing to you. <sp>R/</sp>
    Grant that we might be clothed in kindness, gentleness and patience,
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span> and supporting each other we might have love towards all. <sp>R/</sp>
    Turn our eyes towards the rock from which we were taken,
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span> that we all might faithfully follow our vocation according to the example of our Fathers &mdash; St. Paul the First Hermit and Blessed Eusebius. <sp>R/</sp>
    Grant, that one with all the Saint of the Pauline Order,
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span> we all might contemplate you in heaven for ever. <sp>R/</sp>

<litany>O God, who called the Blessed Eusebius
    into the wilderness of Pilis out of love towards you,
    that there he might offer his life in propitiation for the people
    and gather the scattered hermits,
    grant, we beseech you, that for the sake of his life and intercession
    our order may be made one in faith and love.
    Through our Lord Jesus Christ your Son,
    who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
    one God, for ever and ever.
</litany>
