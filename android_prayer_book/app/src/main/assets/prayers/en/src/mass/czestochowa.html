<h2><span class="rubric">Solemnity</span></h2>

<p><em>
    Władysław, The Duke of Opole, built the monastery of Jasna Góra, for the Pauline Order and
    entrusted to their care the Icon of Our Lady venerated at his castle. Quickly the icon was
    renowned for being miraculous. Its fame increased greatly following the defence of Jasna Góra
    from the Swedes. In the year 1717, the icon was solemnly crowned and Jasna Góra became the chief
    centre of devotion to Our Lady in Poland.

    O Almighty and Merciful God,
    you have wondrously established the most Blessed Virgin Mary
    to be the perpetual help and defence of the Christian people,
    and made her holy image at Jasna Gora renowned by the solemn veneration of the faithful.
    Graciously grant that defended by her protection
    as we fight the battle of life,
    may we be victorious over the evil spirits at the hour of our death.
    Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Your Son,
    who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
    one God for ever and ever.
