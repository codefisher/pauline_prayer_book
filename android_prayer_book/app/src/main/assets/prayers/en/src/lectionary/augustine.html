    reading from the first letter of St. John
</reading>

<p>
    My dear people,
    let us love one another
    since love comes from God
    and everyone who loves is begotten by God and knows God.
    Anyone who fails to love can never have known God,
    because God is love.
    God’s love for us was revealed
    when God sent into the world his only Son
    so that we could have life through him;
    this is the love I mean:
    not our love for God,
    but God’s love for us when he sent his Son
    to be the sacrifice that takes our sins away.
    My dear people,
    since God has loved us so much,
    we too should love one another.
    No one has ever seen God;
    but as long as we love one another
    God will live in us
    and his love will be complete in us.
    We can know that we are living in him
    and he is living in us
    because he lets us share his Spirit.
    We ourselves saw and we testify
    that the Father sent his Son
    as saviour of the world.
    If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God,
    God lives in him, and he in God.
    We ourselves have known and put our faith in
    God’s love towards ourselves.
    God is love
    and anyone who lives in love lives in God,
    and God lives in him.

<reading label="Gospel" ref="23:8-12" tagline="The greatest among you must be your servant">
    A reading from the holy Gospel according to Matthew
</reading>

<p>
    Jesus said to his disciples, &lsquo;You must not allow yourselves to be called Rabbi, since you have
    only one master, and you are all brothers. You must call no one on earth your father, since you
    have only one Father, and he is in heaven. Nor must you allow yourselves to be called teachers,
    for you have only one Teacher, the Christ. The greatest among you must be your servant. Anyone
    who exalts himself will be humbled, and anyone who humbles himself will exalted.&rsquo;
