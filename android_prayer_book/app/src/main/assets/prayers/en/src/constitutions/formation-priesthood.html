<h1 class="index">Chapter III: Post – Novitiate Formation Leading to the Priesthood</h1>


<h2 id="art76">Article 76</h2>

<p>
    Those Brothers called to serve the people of God as Priests must continue their preparation for
    the priesthood which was begun in Novitiate. This consists of a well-rounded development of
    their personality in Christ. In that the students might more easily fulfil their obligations as
    Paulines in the Church, we ought to maintain our own seminaries. They must be organised and
    properly staffed and equipped for offering a full formation on the spiritual, intellectual and
    pastoral levels.
</p>

<h2 id="art77">Article 77</h2>

<p>
    It is the duty of the Major Superior to have special concern and loving care for both students
    and professors in the seminary. He should become for the students a true Father in Christ. All
    members of our Community should regard the seminary as the heart of the Order and gladly render
    it every assistance possible.
</p>


<h2 id="art78">Article 78</h2>

<p>
    The intellectual and pastoral formation of our students is rooted in Spiritual Formation. It
    must be integrally connected with monastic formation as regards a proper program of studies.
    Candidates for the Priesthood are bound to a generous renunciation of everything for the sake of
    God in order to follow Christ. They are so bound by virtue of their covenant with God of which
    Profession is a symbol as well as by virtue of Priestly Ordination, which will conform them to
    the image of Christ the High Priest.
</p>
<p>
    Let them take care then to imitate our Holy Father, St. Paul the Hermit. Let them prepare for
    Pauline Ministry through a life, which is hidden, through work, prayer and penance. The
    effectiveness of their future Apostolate will depend on the degree to which they show forth
    Christ in their personal lives.
</p>

<h2 id="art79">Article 79</h2>

<p>
    Our students must make every effort to become ever more united in the Mystery of the Church.
    They should gladly take part in its life, have an openness to its concerns and be anxious to
    make its salvific presence evident in the world. They should take care to grow in the conviction
    that through the Perpetual Profession and Holy Orders, they accept a fuller responsibility for
    the development and holiness of Christ’s Church and the Pauline Monastic Family. They should
    take care then to bring to greater perfection in themselves a love for Pastoral Activity both in
    the Church and in the Order, take care likewise to develop respect for and obedience to the Holy
    Father, the hierarchy and their Superiors.
</p>

<h2 id="art80">Article 80</h2>

<p>
    As they learn to live according to the Gospels, they must make every effort to continue an
    intimate and constant union with the Father through His Son in the Holy Spirit. They must strive
    to develop their relationship with God through their progress in the virtues of faith, hope and
    love. (Cf: <em>Optatam Totius</em> 8)
</p>
<p>
    Various religious practices tested and approved by the Church assist in bringing about this
    union with God. Among these, the most proper to our Order are meditation on the Word of God and
    zealous participation in the Liturgy of the Hours.
</p>
<p>
    All these practices should lead us to the Eucharistic Sacrifice and should flow from it thereby
    giving our students fuller participation in the Saviour’s Paschal Mystery.
</p>


<h2 id="art81">Article 81</h2>

<p>
    A filial devotion to Mary is essential for a well-rounded complete Pauline formation. Our
    students should honour Her as the Mother of Christ and the Mother of the Church. They should
    imitate Her as the prototype of the People of God and in loving Her should deeply enter Her
    mission in the saving plan of God.
</p>


<h2 id="art82">Article 82</h2>

<p>
    The development of the spiritual life demands guidance. Our students, therefore, must avail
    themselves of the services of a Spiritual Father and confessor. Their relationship to them
    should be one of trust, prompting them to openness in revealing their conscience and working out
    a program for developing their spiritual life.
</p>


<h2 id="art83">Article 83</h2>

<p>
    The educational level of the faithful and the variety of their spiritual needs demand that the
    Priest of Christ enjoy an appropriate and thorough education. This includes a profound knowledge
    of the truths of God, and those concerning human nature and the world. (Cf: <em>Optatam Totius</em> 15)
</p>
<p>
    Our seminaries fulfil this function if the students themselves undertake the work of developing
    their talents and broadening the range of their knowledge and deepening their understanding of
    Divine Truth.
</p>


<h2 id="art84">Article 84</h2>

<p>
    The intellectual formation of the Seminarian consists of at least a six-year course of
    philosophical-theological study. This course of study should be developed according to the norms
    and Decrees of the Apostolic See and in accordance with the mission of our Order.
</p>


<h2 id="art85">Article 85</h2>

<p>
    Under the direction of their teachers, our students should familiarize themselves with
    contemporary culture so that they might more easily hand on the Truth of God to people today.
    They should take care, however, lest they become indiscriminately affected by today’s culture,
    especially that culture which manifests itself through mass media. They must learn to be
    selective as to which values they accept so that they might skilfully incorporate them into the
    world of personal development as well as in the Apostolate. Seminarians must also take advantage
    of those for nurturing and creating culture which they find available.
</p>


<h2 id="art86">Article 86</h2>

<p>
    The entire formation process of our students has as its goal their growth in the knowledge and
    love for the Apostolic Ministry. They must learn to take into account the various problems
    connected with our Order’s Mission as well as with specialized Pastoral Ministry especially as
    found in the Marian Shrines.
</p>
<p>
    It is urgently important to pay attention to, forming responsible and loving Confessors and
    Preachers, as well as a thorough study of Mariology.
</p>


<h2 id="art87">Article 87</h2>

<p>
    All the means of attaining human maturity and supernatural grace which the Seminary offers,
    along with the horarium, only fulfil their function, if seminarians use them consciously and
    with an interior conviction and not from exterior force.
</p>


<h2 id="art88">Article 88</h2>

<p>
    Occasions for a more intensive deepening of our bond with Christ in the Church as we prepare for
    the priesthood will consist of various services and order as well as renewal of Profession
    according to the requirements of our Constitutions and the Code of Canon Law.
</p>
<p>
    Before Diaconate, after a suitable period of preparation, students should make their Solemn
    Profession.
</p>

<h2 id="art89">Article 89</h2>

<p>
    The Rector is responsible for the entire course as well as the outcome of the formation program
    of the students in our Houses of Studies. Normally he would be the Prior. Those assisting him in
    this task will include the Prefect of Seminarians, the Spiritual Father, the Prefect of Studies
    and the Lecturers.
    It is the Rector’s duty to coordinate their activity in a spirit of Brotherly Charity. He
    organises lectures, spiritual exercises and academic pursuits with the help of the Prefect of
    Studies.
</p>

<h2 id="art90">Article 90</h2>

<p>
    The priestly-religious formation of our students is the direct responsibility of the Prefect of
    Students under the direction of the Major Superior. By his nurturing influence he guides the
    students informing attitudes or responsibility for their vocation. He should further see to it
    that they deepen the Pauline Spirit of the Community as he leads them in obeying the Precepts of
    the Church and the Monastery. He guides their earnest preparation of the priesthood and sees to
    it that they grow in the ability to live with people in a cultured way.
</p>
<p>
    The Major Superior with the consent of his council names the Prefect of Seminarians. At an
    appropriate time, he should report to the Major Superior as to the life and religious discipline
    of the Seminarians.
</p>

<h2 id="art91">Article 91</h2>

<p>
    Special care must be exerted to select as educators and lecturers those who are known to have
    specialized knowledge in their fields. They should also be distinguished by their religious
    Discipline, as well as their pastoral experience, and their priestly piety.
</p>
<p>
    Lecturers should fulfil their assigned obligations with total dedication. They are not only
    responsible for the students’ intellectual formation but for their moral development as well.
    This is accomplished by their manner of teaching and by the witness of their personal life as
    well as by their mutual interaction with one another and with the students under the direction
    of the Rector. All should take care to follow a uniform course of training.
</p>
<p>
    Lecturers, Prefect of studies, and Spiritual Directors are selected by the Major Superior with
    the consent of his Council and after consultation with the Rector.
</p>
