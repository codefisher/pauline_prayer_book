<h2>Morning Prayer</h2>

<reading label="Hymn"></reading>

<psalm>
    They come, God’s messengers of love,
    They come from realms of peace above,
    From homes of never fading light,
    From blissful mansions ever bright.

    They come to watch around us here,
    To soothe our sorrow, calm our fear:
    Ye heavenly guides, speed not away,
    God willeth you with us to stay.

    But chiefly at its journey’s end
    ’Tis yours the spirit to befriend,
    And whisper to the faithful heart,
    &lsquo;O Christian soul, in peace depart.&rsquo;

    To us the zeal of angels give,
    With love to serve thee while we live;
    To us an Angel-guard supply,
    When on the bed of death we lie.
</psalm>

    He will give líght to those in dárkness, +
    - those who dwéll in the shádow of déath, *
    - and gúide us into the wáy of péace.
