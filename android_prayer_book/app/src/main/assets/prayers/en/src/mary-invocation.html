<h1>6. Invocation to Implore the Intercession of the Immaculate Conception</h1>

<p>
O Most Holy Virgin, I believe in your Holy and Immacu-
late Conception, always pure and undefiled, and I confess it before
the whole world.
</p>

<p>
O Virgin most pure, through your Immaculate Conception
and through your great dignity as Mother of God, implore for me,
from your Son, the virtue of deep humility, of perfect love, of in-
tact chastity of heart, body and soul, the grace of final perseverance
in my beloved vocation, the gift of worthy prayer and the grace of a
happy death. Amen.
