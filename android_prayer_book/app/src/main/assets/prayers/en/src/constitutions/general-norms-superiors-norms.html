<h2 id="norm144">Norm 144</h2>

<p>
    Among the most important obligations of Superiors is that of organizing the work of Community in
    a wise and purposeful fashion. Therefore, Superiors should assign offices and responsibilities
    taking into consideration preparations and abilities of each confrere. Showing interest in the
    members the Superiors should respect all good initiatives and facilitate their execution.
</p>

<h2 id="norm145">Norm 145</h2>

<p>
    In undertaking decisions Superiors should be guided by evangelical charity and prudence.
    Therefore, although they should always keep in mind the Lord, the good of the Order and the
    Brother in question, they should make allowance for human weakness.
</p>


<h2 id="norm146">Norm 146</h2>

<p>
    For the purpose of exchanging experiences and of maintaining one line of action in accord with
    the mission of the Order and actual needs, the Superiors of Houses should meet together at least
    once a year together with the Major Superior.
