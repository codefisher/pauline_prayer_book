<psalm>
    The God whom earth, and sea, and sky,
    Adore, and laud, and magnify,
    Who o’er their threefold fabric reigns,
    The Virgin’s spotless womb contains.

    The God, whose will by moon and sun,
    And all things in due course is done,
    Is borne upon a maiden’s breast,
    By fullest heavenly grace possessed.

    How blest that Mother in whose shrine,
    That great Creator Divine,
    Whose hand contains the earth and sky,
    Vouchsafed, as in his ark, to lie!

    Blest, in the message Gabriel brought;
    Blest, by the work the Spirit wrought;
    From whom the great Desire of earth,
    Took human flesh and human birth.

    All honour, laud, and glory be,
    O Jesu, Virgin-born, to You!
    All glory, as is ever meet,
    To Father and to Paraclete. Amen.

</reading>

<p>
    I hear my Beloved.
    See how he comes
    leaping on the mountains,
    bounding over the hill.
    My Beloved is like a gazelle,
    like a young stag.

    See where he stands,
    behind our wall.
    He looks in at the window,
    he peers through the lattice.

    My Beloved lifts up his voice,
    he says to me,
    &lsquo;Come then, my love,
    my lovely one, come.
    For see, winter is past,
    the rains are over and gone.
    The flowers appear on the earth.
    The season of glad songs has come,
    the cooing of the turtledove is heard
    in our land.
    The fig tree is forming its first figs
    and the blossoming vines give out their fragrance.
    Come then, my love,
    my lovely one, come.
    My dove, hiding in the clefts of the rock,
    in the coverts of the cliff,
    show me your face,
    let me hear your voice;
    for your voice is sweet
    and your face is beautiful.&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
    Set me like a seal on your heart,
    like a seal on your arm.
    For love is strong as Death,
    jealousy relentless as Sheol.
    The flash of it is a flash of fire,
    a flame of the Lord himself.
    Love no flood can quench,
    no torrents drown.

    Selected passages from the allocation of St. John Paul II at the Monastery of Jasna Gora, 19 Jun 1983
</reading>

<p>
    In union of heart and soul with the Church and all of you, I praise God for these six centuries
    of Jasna Gora, and I wish to express my gratitude for these centuries of yours too; for all the
    generations of servants of God, sons of Saint Paul the First Hermit. They looked after, served,
    and defended, when necessary, this sanctuary, as our beloved father Augustyn Kordecki did.
</p>
<p>
    My beloved brothers, this is a great gift from God, such a gift of grace has become the
    distinctive charisma of your Order, since whenever you are in Jasna Gora, in Poland, and
    elsewhere in the world, this charisma of your Order which is the service to the local Church
    (indeed a service to the universal Church) is fully expressed through the ministry in Jasna Gora.
</p>
<p>
    I wish to say that Jasna Gora is the heart of all pastoral activity in Poland, especially as far
    as the ministry of Penance is concerned. A difficult service, a service of responsibility. Such
    a pastoral service requires a particular spiritual maturity from each one of you, as well as an
    intense interior life, a religious effort toward perfection. And perfection, we know, is a path
    to charity.
</p>
<p>
    Therefore, you have to spread this love and also be its servants. You have to let yourselves be
    permeated by it. This is your special religious perfection. Demand this perfection from
    yourselves; grow in it day by day; let it be the heart, the purpose, the aim of your vocation.
    This is a special vocation, it is a great vocation; the Pauline vocation and the vocation of
    Jasna Gora. I rejoice with you for such a vocation on this solemn day of the Sixth Centenary of
    the presence of the miraculous Image of our Lady of Jasna Gora, and my joy expresses a
    thanksgiving to the Lord. On this day of jubilee I pray for a growth of vocations to and charisma of
    your Order through coming generations, and for a growth of your ministry in Jasna Gora. May your
    charisma increase under the movement of the Holy Spirit and the help of Mary, the Handmaid of
    the Lord, the Spouse of the Holy Spirit. Their guidance is necessary in these times of
    difficulties, turmoil, and conflict.
</p>
<p>
    Your spiritual confrere Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski, of blessed memory, used to express the same
    concern and wish. Let me recall his words: “non est nobis conluctatio adversus carnem et
    sanguinem sed adversus principes tenebrarum harum.” (Eph 6:12). In the course of history,
    especially during the hard times, Mary is given to us as a sign: “A woman, whose dress was the
    sun and who had the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head” (Rev 12: 1),
    recalling John’s words. In these times and in this struggle against the powers of darkness it is
    urgently required that the power of the Holy Spirit radiate through his Purest Spouse.
</p>
<p>
    And you, dear brothers, are radiating this in your monastic and pastoral life.
</p>
<p>
    I know that present here in the sanctuary of Jasna Gora many prayers are raised for me, for the
    Pope. My predecessors, John XXIII (through the Primate Wyszynski) and Paul VI asked for prayers
    in this holy place. I did, too, and I repeat my request today, because much of today’s struggle
    is against the Holy See, against Peter and his ministry, Peter and his mission. Let us pray
    together, let us struggle together, let us love together, because this is a struggle which needs
    love. On love, Christ asked Peter: “Do you love me?” (Jn 21: 15). Love is the only strength that
    we have in this difficult struggle. This is why we want to be united with the Woman who loved
    and loves with the greatest love. If we remain with her we will love.
</p>
<p>
    And to all here present, I bless you with all my heart.
</p>

    - Enthroned at God’s right hand in the glory of the Father, *
    - you will come in judgement according to your promise.

    You redeemed your people by your precious blood. *
