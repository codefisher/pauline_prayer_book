<h2><span class="rubric">Feast</span></h2>

<p><em>
    Born at Thagaste in Africa in the year 354. As a young man he led an unsettled life both in the
    philosophy he professed and in his moral behaviour, but later in the year 387, he was converted
    and received baptism at Milan from the bishop Saint Ambrose. He came back to his own country and
    led the life of an ascetic. Elected Bishop of Hippo, for thirty-four years he was an exemplary
    bishop to his flock, teaching his people by his sermons and writings, striving to combat the
    errors of the time and to make the faith understood. He died in the year 430.
