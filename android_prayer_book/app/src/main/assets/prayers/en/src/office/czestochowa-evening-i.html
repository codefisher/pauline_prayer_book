<h2><span class="rubric">Solemnity</span></h2>

<p><em>
    Władysław, The Duke of Opole, built the monastery of Jasna Góra, for the Pauline Order and
    entrusted to their care the Icon of Our Lady venerated at his castle. Quickly the icon was
    renowned for being miraculous. Its fame increased greatly following the defence of Jasna Góra
    from the Swedes. In the year 1717, the icon was solemnly crowned and Jasna Góra became the chief
    centre of devotion to Our Lady in Poland.

<h2>Evening Prayer I</h2>

<reading label="Hymn"></reading>

<psalm>
    Hail Queen of heaven, the ocean star,
    Guide of the wand’rer here below!
    Thrown on life’s surge, we claim thy care:
    Save us from peril and from woe.
    Mother of Christ, star of the sea,
    Pray for the wand’rer, pray for me.

    O gentle, chaste and spotless maid,
    We sinners make our prayers through thee;
    Remind thy son that he has paid
    The price of our iniquity.
    Virgin most pure, star of the sea,
    Pray for the sinner, pray for me.

    Sojourners in this vale of tears,
    To thee, blest advocate, we cry;
    Pity our sorrow, calm our fears,
    And soothe with hope our misery.
    Refuge in grief, star of the sea,
    Pray for the mourner, pray for me.

    And while to him who reigns above,
    In Godhead one, in Persons Three,
    The source of life, of grace, of love,
    Homage we pay on bended knee;
    Do thou, bright Queen, star of the sea,
    Pray for thy children, pray for me.
</psalm>

    Práise, O sérvants of the Lórd, *
    - práise the náme of the Lórd!
    May the náme of the Lórd be bléssed *
    - both nów and for évermóre!

    Whó is like the Lórd, our Gód, *
    - who has rísen on hígh to his thróne
    yet stóops from the héights to look dówn, *
    - to look dówn upon héaven and éarth?

    From the dúst he lífts up the lówly, *
    - from the dúngheap he ráises the póor
    to sét him in the cómpany of prínces, *
    - yés, with the prínces of his péople.
    To the chíldless wífe he gives a hóme *
    - and gláddens her héart with chíldren.

    In the days to come
    the mountain of the Temple of the Lord
    shall tower above the mountains
    and be lifted higher than the hills.
    All the nations will stream to it,
    peoples without number will come to it; and they will say:
    &lsquo;Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord,
    to the Temple of the God of Jacob
    that he may teach us his ways
    so that we may walk in his paths.&rsquo;

<litany>
    O Almighty and Merciful God,
    you have wondrously established the most Blessed Virgin Mary
    to be the perpetual help and defence of the Christian people,
    and made her holy image at Jasna Gora renowned
    by the solemn veneration of the faithful.
    Graciously grant that defended by her protection
    as we fight the battle of life,
    may we be victorious over the evil spirits at the hour of our death.
    Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Your Son,
    who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
    one God for ever and ever.
</litany>
