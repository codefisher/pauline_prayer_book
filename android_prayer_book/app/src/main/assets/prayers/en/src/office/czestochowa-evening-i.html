<p><em>
    Władysław, The Duke of Opole, built the monastery of Jasna Góra, for the Pauline Order and
    entrusted to their care the Icon of Our Lady venerated at his Castle. Quickly the Icon was
    renowned for being miraculous. Its fame increased greatly from after the defence of Jasna Góra
    from the Swedes. In the year 1717, the Icon was solemnly crowned and Jasna Góra become the chief

<h2>Evening Prayer I</h2>

<reading label="Hymn"></reading>

<psalm>
    Hail Queen of heaven, the ocean star,
    Guide of the wand’rer here below;
    Thrown on life’s surge, we claim thy care:
    Save us from peril and from woe.
    Mother of Christ, star of the sea,
    Pray for the wand’rer, pray for me.

    O gentle, chaste and spotless maid,
    We sinners make our prayers through thee;
    Remind thy son that he has paid
    The price of our iniquity.
    Virgin most pure, star of the sea,
    Pray for the sinner, pray for me.

    Sojourners in this vale of tears,
    To thee, blest advocate, we cry;
    Pity our sorrow, calm our fears,
    And soothe with hope our misery.
    Refuge in grief, star of the sea,
    Pray for the mourner, pray for me.

    And while to him who reigns above,
    In godhead one, in persons three,
    The source of life, of grace, of love,
    Homage we pay on bended knee;
    Do thou, bright Queen, star of the sea,
    Pray for thy children, pray for me.
</psalm>

<psalm>
    Praise, O servants of the Lord, *
    - praise the name of the Lord!
    May the name of the Lord be blessed *
    - both now and for evermore!
    From the rising of the sun to its setting *
    - praise be the name of the Lord!

    High above all the nations is the Lord, *
    - above the heavens his glory.
    Who is like the Lord, our God, *
    - who has rise on high to his throne
    Yet stoops from the heights to look down, *
    - to look down upon heaven and earth.

    From the dust he lifts up the lowly, *
    - from his misery he raises the poor
    To set him in the company of princes, *
    - yes, with the princes of his people.
    To the Childless wife he gives a home *
    - and gladdens her heart with children.

<psalm>
    O praise the Lord, Jerusalem! *
    - Zion, praise your God!

    He has strengthened the bars of your gates *
    - he has blessed the children within you.
    He established peace on your borders, *
    - he feeds you with finest wheat.

    He sends out his word to the earth *
    - and swiftly runs his command.
    He showers down snow white as wool, *
    - he scatters hoar-frost like ashes.

    He hurls down hailstones like crumbs. *
    - The waters are frozen at his touch;
    he sends forth his word and it melts them: *
    - at the breath of his mouth the waters flow.

    He makes his word known to Jacob, *
    - to Israel his laws and decrees.
    He has not dealt thus with other nations; *
    - he has not taught them his decrees.

<psalm>
    Blessed be the God and Father *
    - of our Lord Jesus Christ,
    who has blessed us in Christ *
    - with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places.

    He chose us in him *
    - before the foundation of the world,
    that we should be holy *
    - and blameless before him.

    He destined us in love *
    - to be his sons through Jesus Christ,

    - to the praise of his glorious grace *
    - which he freely bestowed on us in the beloved.

    In him we have redemption through his blood, *

    He has made known to us †
    - in all wisdom and insight *
    - the mystery of his will,
    according to his purpose *

<p>
    In the days to come
    the mountain of the Temple of the Lord
    shall tower above the mountains
    and be lifted higher than the hills.
    All the nations will stream to it,
    peoples without number will come to it; and they will say:
    &lsquo;Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord,
    to the Temple of the GOd of Jacob
    that he may teach us his ways
    so that we may walk in his paths.&rsquo;

    My soul glorifies the Lord, *
    - my spirit rejoices in God, my Saviour.
    He looks on his servant in her lowliness; *
    - henceforth all ages will call me blessed.

    The Almighty works marvels for me. *
    - Holy his name!
    His mercy is from age to age, *
    - on those who fear him.


    He puts forth his arm in strength *
    - and scatters the proud hearted.
    He casts the mighty from their thrones *

    He fills the starving with good things, *

    He protects Israel, his servant, *
    - remembering his mercy,
    the mercy promised to our fathers, *
    - to Abraham and his sons forever.

    Let us praise God the Father who chose Mary as the mother of his Son and wanted all generations to call her blessed. With confidence we pray: <br />  <sp>R/</sp> <em>May the Virgin Mary intercede for us.</em>
    Father, you have looked on the Virgin Mary and made her the mother of mercy:
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span>may those who are in danger experience the depth of her love. <sp>R/</sp>
    You called Mary to be the mother in the house of Jesus and Joseph:
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span>through her prayers help all mothers to make their homes places of love and holiness. <sp>R/</sp>
    You gave Mary the strength to stand beneath the cross and made her radiant with joy in the resurrection;
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span>raise up the sorrowful and transform their lives with hope. <sp>R/</sp>
    Mary was your faithful handmaid who treasured your words in her heart;
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span>through her intercession let us become true disciples of your Son, devoted to his service. <sp>R/</sp>
    Father, you exalted the Virgin Mary and crowned her queen of heaven;

<reading label="Concluding Prayer"></reading>

<litany>
    O Almighty and Merciful God,
    you have wondrously made the most Blessed Virgin Mary
    to be the perpetual help and defence of the Christian people,
    and made her holy image at Jasna Gora renowned by the solemn veneration of the faithful.
    Defended by her protection,
    as we fight the battle of life,
    may we be victorious over the evil spirits at the hour of our death.
    Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Your Son,
    who lives and reigns with You in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
    one God for ever and ever.
</litany>
