<h1 class="index" id="hymns">Hymns for Night Prayer</h1>

<psalm red="109">
    Christ, the true light of us, true morn,
    Dispersing far the shades of night,
    Light whereof every light is born,
    Pledge of the beatific light,

    Thou all the night our guardian be
    Whose watch no sleep or slumber knows;
    Thou be our peace, that stayed on thee
    Through darkness we may find repose.

    Sleep then our eyes, but never sleep
    The watchful heaven-directed heart,
    And may thy hand in safety keep
    The servants whose desire thou art.

    Look on us, thou, and at our side
    Our foes and thine repulse afar:
    Through every ill the faithful guide
    Who in thy blood redeemed are.

    While soul within the body clings,
    Body and soul defend us, Lord.
    Sure in the shadow of thy wings,
    Kept in thy lasting watch and ward.

<psalm red="110">
    Now it is evening; time to cease from labour,
    Father, according to thy will and pleasure,
    Through the night-season, have thy faithful people
    Safe in thy keeping.

    Far from our dwellings drive the evil spirits;
    Under the shadow of thy wings protect us;
    Be thou our guardian through the hours of darkness,
    Strong to defend us.

    Call we, ere sleeping, on the name of Jesus;
    Rise we at day-break, strong to serve thee better;
    Order our goings, well begun and ended,
    All to thy glory.

    Fountain of goodness, bless the sick and needy;
    Visit the captive, solace the afflicted;
    Shelter the stranger, feed your starving children;
    Strengthen the dying.

    Father, who neither slumberest nor sleepest,
    Thou, to whom darkness is as clear as noonday,
    Have us this night-time, for the sake of Jesus,
    Safe in thy keeping.

<psalm red="111">
    Lead, kindly light, amid the encircling gloom,
    Lead thou me on;
    The night is dark, and I am far from home,
    Lead thou me on.
    Keep thou my feet; I do not ask to see
    The distant scene; one step enough for me.

    I was not ever thus, nor prayed that thou
    Shouldst lead me on;
    I loved to choose and see my path; but now
    Lead thou me on.
    I loved the garish day, and, spite of fears,
    Pride ruled my will: remember not past years.

    So long thy power hath blest me, sure it still
    Will lead me on
    O’er moor and fen, o’er crag and torrent, till
    The night is gone,
    And with the morn those angel faces smile,
    Which I have loved long since, and lost awhile.

<psalm red="112">
    Abide with me; fast flows the eventide;
    The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide;
    When other helpers fail, and comforts flee,
    Help of the helpless, O abide with me.

    Swift to its close ebbs out life’s little day:
    Earth’s joys grow dim, its glories pass away;
    Change and decay in all around I see;
    O thou who changes not, abide with me.

    Hold thou thy Cross before my closing eyes;
    Shine through the gloom, and point me to the skies;
    Heaven’s morning breaks, and earth’s vain shadows flee;
    In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.

<psalm red="113">
    The day thou gavest, Lord, is ended.
    The darkness falls at thy behest,
    To Thee our morning hymns ascended,
    Thy praise shall sanctify our rest.

    We thank thee that thy Church unsleeping,
    While earth rolls onward into light,
    Through all the world her watch is keeping,
    And rests not now by day or night.

    As over continent and island
    The dawn leads on another day,
    The voice of prayer is never silent,
    Nor dies the strain of praise away.

    The sun that bids us rest is waking
    Our brethren ’neath the western sky,
    And hour by hour fresh lips are making
    Thy wondrous doings heard on high.

    So be it, Lord, thy throne shall never,
    Like earth's proud empires, pass away;
    Thy kingdom stands, and grows for ever,
    Till all thy creatures own thy sway.

<psalm red="114">
    Now thank we all our God,
    With heart and hands and voices,
    Who wondrous things has done,
    In Whom this world rejoices;
    Who from our mothers’ arms
    Has blessed us on our way
    With countless gifts of love,
    And still is ours today.

    O may this bounteous God
    Through all our life be near us,
    With ever joyful hearts
    And blessed peace to cheer us;
    And keep us in His grace,
    And guide us when perplexed;
    And free us from all ills,
    In this world and the next!

    All praise and thanks to God
    The Father now be given;
    The Son and Him Who reigns
    With Them in highest Heaven;
    The one eternal God,
    Whom earth and Heaven adore;
    For thus it was, is now,
    And shall be evermore.

<psalm red="115">
    Lord of all hopefulness, Lord of all joy,
    Whose trust, ever childlike, no cares could destroy,
    Be there at our waking, and give us, we pray,
    Your bliss in our hearts, Lord, at the break of the day.

    Lord of all eagerness, Lord of all faith,
    Whose strong hands were skilled at the plane and the lathe,
    Be there at our labours and give us, we pray,
    Your strength in our hearts, Lord, at the noon of the day.

    Lord of all kindliness, Lord of all grace,
    Your hands swift to welcome, Your arms to embrace.
    Be there at our homing, and give us, we pray,
    Your love in our hearts, Lord, at the eve of the day.

    Lord of all gentleness, Lord of all calm,
    Whose voice is contentment, whose presence is balm,
    Be there at our sleeping, and give us, we pray,
    Your peace in our hearts, Lord, at the end of the day.

<psalm red="116">
    O Saviour, bless us e’re we go;
    Thy word into our minds instil,
    And make our lukewarm hearts to glow
    With lowly love and fervent will.
    Through life’s long day and death’s dark night,
    O gentle Jesus, be our light.

    The day is done, its hours have run;
    And thou hast taken count of all,
    The scanty triumphs grace hath won,
    The broken vow, the frequent fall.
    Through life’s long day and death’s dark night,
    O gentle Jesus, be our light.

    For all we love, the poor, the sad,
    The sinful, &mdash; unto thee we call;
    O let thy mercy make us glad;
    Thou art our Jesus and our All.
    Through life’s long day and death’s dark night,
    O gentle Jesus, be our light.
