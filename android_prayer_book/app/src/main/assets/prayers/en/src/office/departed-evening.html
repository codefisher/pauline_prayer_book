<psalm>
    Merciful Saviour, hear our humble pray'r,
    For all thy servants passed beyond life's care;
    Though sin has touched them, yet their weakness spare.
    O grant them pardon, Jesus Saviour blest,
    And give their spirits light and endless rest.

    O gentle Saviour, Lamb for sinners slain,
    Look on thy brothers, cleanse their hearts of stain:
    Thy cross has won them everlasting gain.
    O grant them pardon, Jesus Saviour blest,
    And give their spirits light and endless rest.

    Lord, at they Passion love did conquer fear;
    Now share that triumph with these souls so dear:
    Banish their sorrows, let thy light appear.
    O grant them pardon, Jesus Saviour blest,
    And give their spirits light and endless rest.

<psalm>
    I líft up my éyes to the móuntains: *
    - from whére shall come my hélp?
    My hélp shall cóme from the Lórd *
    - who made héaven and éarth.

    May he néver állow you to stúmble! *
    - Let him sléep not, your gúard.
    Nó, he sléeps not nor slúmbers, *
    - Ísrael’s gúard.

    The Lórd is your gúard and your sháde; *
    - at your ríght side he stánds.
    By dáy the sún shall not smíte you *
    - nor the móon in the níght.

    The Lórd will gúard you from évil, *
    - he will gúard your sóul.
    The Lord will gúard your góing and cóming *
    - both nów and for éver.

<psalm>
    Out of the dépths I crý to you, O Lórd, *
    - Lórd, hear my vóice!
    O lét your éars be atténtive *

    If you, O Lórd, should márk our gúilt, *
    - Lórd, who would survíve?
    But with yóu is fóund forgíveness: *
    - for thís we revére you.

    My sóul is wáiting for the Lórd. *
    - I cóunt on his wórd.
    My sóul is lónging for the Lórd *
    - more than wátchman for dáybreak.
    Let the wátchman cóunt on dáybreak *
    - and Ísrael on the Lórd.

    Becáuse with the Lórd there is mércy *
    - and fúllness of redémption,

</p>
<p class="ref">Canticle Phil 2:6-11</p>

<psalm>
    Though he was in the form of God, *
    - Jesus did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped.

    He emptied himself, †
    - taking the form of a servant, *
    - being born in the likeness of men.

    And being found in human form, †
    - he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, *
    - even death on a cross.

    Therefore God has highly exalted him *
    - and bestowed on him the name which is above every name,

    That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, *
    - in heaven and on earth and under the earth,

    And every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, *
    - to the glory of God the Father.

    Death, where is your victory? Death, where is your sting? Now the sting of death is sin, and sin gets its power from the Law. So let us thank God for giving us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

    My soul glórifies the Lórd, *
    - my spirit rejóices in Gód, my Sáviour.
    He looks on his sérvant in her lówliness; *

    The Almíghty works márvels for me. *

    Christ, our Redeemer, destroy the reign of sin in our mortal bodies;

    O God, glory of the faithful and life of the just,
    by the Death and Resurrection of whose Son
    we have been redeemed,
    look mercifully on your departed servants,
    the brothers, relatives and benefactors of our Order,
    that, just as they professed the mystery of our resurrection,
    so they may merit to receive the joys of eternal happiness.
    Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
    who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
    one God, for ever and ever.
