<h1>4. Saint Augustine</h1>

<p class="instruction">
    St. Augustine (354-430), bishop of Hippo, Doctor of the
    Church is the Father and Legislator of our Order. As the result of
    his deep conversion in 385 after a dissolute life style, he was bap-
    tized by St. Ambrose at the age of 33 and admitted to the Catholic Church
    on December 8th. Shortly after, he resigned from the post as the
    teacher of rhetoric, sold his inheritance, and started a monastic life,
    which he organized in Tagaste (North Africa) in 391. The same
    year, he was ordained a priest and dedicated himself to the studies
    of Scriptures. In 396 he was consecrated Bishop of Hippo. In his
    pastoral administration, St. Augustine cared for the clergy and mo-
    nastic life. He combated Manichees, the Donatists and Pelagius.
    His works: The Confessions, City of God and over 500 homilies are
    well known and appreciated in the West. For his sublime achieve-
    ments in theology and spirituality, the Latin Church rewarded him
    with the title: “Doctor of Grace.” He composed a Rule that is
    observed by some 150 religious communities today. It was his
    Rule that was given to our Founding Fathers to follow: the Broth-
    ers of St. Paul the First Hermit. On December 13, 1308 with the
    decree “Ubi Saecularia”, signed by Pope Clement V, through the
    mediation of his Legate, Cardinal Gentilis de Monte Florido, our
    Order was officially approved by the Church and the Rule of St.
    Augustine was assigned to it to live by.

<h2>4.2 Prayer to St. Augustine</h2>

<p class="indent">
    O St. Augustine, wondrous Doctor of Grace! You wrote
    and sang of God’s merciful love that worked wonders in your soul.
    Help us to trust in God’s help alone. You knew the tragedy of sin.
    You experienced the darkness of error and the chains of pride and
    sensuality and endured the pain of alienation from God. But the
    Lord saw the tears and heard the supplications of your saintly
    mother, Monica. Because of her unceasing prayer, God in his great
    mercy, rescued you from the darkness of Satan and immersed you
    in his divine light.
</p>

<p class="indent">
    O great St. Augustine! Help us to discover God as our
    eternal Truth, as our true Love and as our beloved Eternity. Teach
    us to believe in Him and to remain in the state of grace always.
    Teach us to pray constantly to overcome the weakness of our flesh.
    Accompany us on our pilgrimage to the endless Life. Pray for us
    to know the Lord better, to love Him more and to be worthy to
    reign with Him for ever and ever. Amen.
