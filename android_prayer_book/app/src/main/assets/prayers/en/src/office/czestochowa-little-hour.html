<h2>Prayer During the Day</h2>

<reading label="Hymn"></reading>

<psalm>
    God, who made the earth and sky
    And the changing sea,
    Clothed his glory in our flesh:
    Man, with men to be.

    Mary, Virgin filled with light,
    Chosen from our race,
    Bore the Father’s only Son
    By the Spirit’s grace.

    He whom nothing can contain,
    No one can compel,
    Bound his timeless Godhead here,
    In our time to dwell.

    God, our Father, Lord of days,
    And his only Son,
    With the Holy Spirit praise:
    Trinity in One.
</psalm>

<reading shorttag="The Lord is the hope of his people" ref="Psalm 122 (123)"></reading>

<psalm>
    To yóu have I lífted up my éyes, *
    - you who dwéll in the héavens;
    my éyes, like the éyes of sláves *
    - on the hánd of their lórds.

    Líke the éyes of a sérvant *
    - on the hánd of her místress,
    so our éyes are on the Lórd our Gód *
    - till he shów us his mércy.

    Have mércy on us, Lórd, have mércy. *
    - We are fílled with contémpt.
    Indéed all too fúll is our sóul +
    - with the scórn of the rích, *
    - with the próud man’s disdáin.
</psalm>

<reading shorttag="Our help is in the name of the Lord" ref="Psalm 123 (124)"></reading>

<psalm>
    &lsquo;If the Lórd had not béen on our síde,&rsquo; *
    - this is Ísrael’s sóng.
    &lsquo;If the Lórd had not béen on our síde *
    - when mén rose up agáinst us,
    thén would they have swállowed us alíve *
    - when their ánger was kíndled.

    &lsquo;Thén would the wáters have engúlfed us, *
    - the tórrent gone óver us;
    óver our héad would have swépt *
    - the ráging wáters.&rsquo;

    Bléssed be the Lórd who did not gíve us *
    - a préy to their téeth!
    Our lífe, like a bírd, has escáped *
    - from the snáre of the fówler.

    Indéed the snáre has been bróken *
    - and wé have escáped.
    Our hélp is in the náme of the Lórd, *
    - who made héaven and éarth.
</psalm>

<reading shorttag="The Lord, the protector of his people" ref="Psalm 124 (125)"></reading>

<psalm>
    Thóse who put their trúst in the Lórd +
    - are like Mount Síon, that cánnot be sháken, *
    - that stánds for éver.

    Jerúsalem! The móuntains surróund her, +
    - so the Lórd surróunds his péople *
    - both nów and for éver.

    For the scéptre of the wícked shall not rést *
    - over the lánd of the júst
    for féar that the hánds of the júst *
    - should túrn to évil.

    Do góod, Lord, to thóse who are góod, *
    - to the úpright of héart;
    but the cróoked and thóse who do évil, *
    - dríve them awáy!

    On Ísrael, péace!

<litany>
    O Almighty and Merciful God,
    you have wondrously established the most Blessed Virgin Mary
    to be the perpetual help and defence of the Christian people,
    and made her holy image at Jasna Gora renowned
    by the solemn veneration of the faithful.
    Graciously grant that defended by her protection
    as we fight the battle of life,
    may we be victorious over the evil spirits at the hour of our death.
    Through Christ Our Lord.
</litany>
