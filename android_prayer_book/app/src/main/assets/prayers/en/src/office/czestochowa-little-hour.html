<h2>Prayer During the Day</h2>

<reading label="Hymn"></reading>

<psalm>
    God, who made the earth and sky
    And the changing sea,
    Clothed his glory in our flesh:
    Man, with men to be.

    Mary, Virgin filled with light,
    Chosen from our race,
    Bore the Father’s only
    Son By the Spirit’s grace.

    He whom nothing can contain,
    No one can compel,
    Bound his timeless Godhead here,
    In our time to dwell.

    God, our Father, Lord of days,
    And his only Son,
    With the Holy Spirit praise:
    Trinity in One.

<reading shorttag="The Lord is the hope of his people" ref="Psalm 122 (123)"></reading>

<psalm>
    To you have I lifted up my eyes, *
    - you who dwell in the heavens :
    my eyes, like the eyes of slaves *
    - on the hand of their lords.

    Like the eyes of a servant *
    - on the hand of her mistress,
    so our eyes are on The Lord our God *
    - till he shows us his mercy.

    Have mercy on us, Lord, have mercy. *
    - We are filled with contempt.
    Indeed all too full is our soul †
    - with the scorn of the rich, *
    - with the proud man’s disdain.
</psalm>

<reading shorttag="Our help is in the name of the Lord" ref="Psalm 123 (124)"></reading>

<psalm>
    ‘If The Lord had been on our side,’ *
    - this is Israel’s song.
    ‘If The Lord had been on our side *
    - when men rose against us,
    then they would have swallowed us alive *
    - when their anger was kindled.

    Then would the waters have engulfed us, *
    - the torrent gone over us ;
    over our head would have swept *
    - the raging waters.’

    Blessed be The Lord who did not give us *
    - a prey to their teeth!
    Our life, like a bird, has escaped *
    - from the same snare of the fowler.

    Indeed the snare has been broken *
    - and we have escaped.
    Our help is in the name of The Lord, *
    - who made heaven and earth.
</psalm>

<reading shorttag="The Lord, the protector of his people" ref="Psalm 124 (125)"></reading>

<psalm>
    Those who put their trust in The Lord †
    - are like Mount Sion, that cannot be shaken, *
    - that stands forever.

    Jerusalem! The mountains surround her, †
    - so The Lord surrounds his people *
    - both now and forever.

    For the sceptre of the wicked shall not rest *
    - over the land of the just
    for fear that the hands of the just *
    - should turn to evil.

    Do good, Lord, to those who are good, *
    - to the upright of heart ;
    but the crooked and those who do evil, †
    - drive them away! *

    On Israel, peace!
</psalm>

<reading label="Concluding Prayer"></reading>

<litany>
    O Almighty and Merciful God,
    you have wondrously made the most Blessed Virgin Mary
    to be the perpetual help and defence of the Christian people,
    and made her holy image at Jasna Gora renowned by the solemn veneration of the faithful.
    Defended by her protection,
    as we fight the battle of life,
    may we be victorious over the evil spirits at the hour of our death.
    Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Your Son,
    who lives and reigns with You in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
    one God for ever and ever.
</litany>
