<psalm>
    Star of sea and ocean,
    gateway to man's haven,
    mother of our Maker,
    hear our pray'r, O Maiden.

    Welcoming the <em>Ave</em>
    of God's simple greeting
    you have borne a Savior
    far beyond all dreaming.

    Loose the bonds that hold us
    bound in sin's own blindness
    that with eyes now open'd
    God's own light may guide us.

    Show yourself our mother
    he will hear your pleading
    whom your womb has sheltered
    and whose hand brings healing.

    Gentlest of all virgins,
    that our love be faithful
    keep us from all evil
    gentle, strong, and grateful.

    Guard us through life's dangers
    never turn and leave us,
    may our hope find harbor
    in the calm of Jesus.

    Sing to God our Father
    through the Son who saves us
    joyful in the Spirit
    everlasting praises.

    <span class="rubric">Ant. 1:</span> Hail Mary, full of grace: the Lord is with you.
</p>
<p class="ref">Psalm 121 (122)</p>
<psalm>
    I rejoiced when I heard them say : *
    - ‘Let us go to God’s house.’
    And now our feet are standing *
    - within your gates, O Jerusalem.

    Jerusalem us built as a city *
    - strongly compact.
    It is there that the tribes go up, *
    - the tribes of the Lord.

    For Israel’s law it is, *
    - there to praise the Lord’s name.
    There were set the thrones of judgement *
    - of the house of David.

    For the peace of Jerusalem pray : *
    - ‘Peace be to your homes !
    May peace reign in your walls, *
    - in your palaces, peace ! *

    For love of my brethren and friends *
    - I say : ‘Peace upon you !’
    For the love of the house of the Lord *
    - I will ask for your good.

    <span class="rubric">Ant. 2:</span> I am the servant of th Lord; let it be as you have said.
</p>
<p class="ref">Psalm 126 (127)</p>
<psalm>
    If the Lord does not build the house, *
    - in vain do its builders labour ;
    if the Lord does not watch over the city, *
    - in vain does the watchmen keep vigil.

    In vain is your earlier rising, *
    - your going later to rest,
    you who toil for the bread you eat : *
    - when he pours gifts on his beloved while they slumber.

    Truly sons are a gift from the Lord, *
    - a blessing, the fruit of the womb.
    Indeed the sons of youth *
    - are like arrows in the hand of a warrior.

    O the happiness of the man *
    - who has filled his quiver with these arrows !
    He will have no cause for shame *
    - when he disputes with his foes in the gateways.

<psalm>
    Blessed be the God and Father *
    - of our Lord Jesus Christ,
    who has blessed us in Christ *
    - with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places.

    He chose us in him *
    - before the foundation of the world,
    that we should be holy *
    - and blameless before him.

    He destined us in love *
    - to be his sons through Jesus Christ,
    according to the purpose of his will, †
    - to the praise of his glorious grace *
    - which he freely bestowed on us in the Beloved.

    In him we have redemption through his blood, *
    - the forgiveness of our trespasses,
    according to the riches of his grace *
    - which he lavished upon us.

    He has made known to us †
    - in all wisdom and insight *
    - the mystery of his will,
    according to his purpose *
    - which he set forth in Christ.

    His purpose he set forth in Christ, *
    - as a plan for the fullness of time,
    to unite all things in him, *
    - things in heaven and things on earth.

<psalm>
    My soul glorifies the Lord, *
    - my spirit rejoices in God, my Saviour.
    He looks on his servant in her lowliness; *
    - henceforth all ages will call me blessed.

    The Almighty works marvels for me. *
    - Holy his name!
    His mercy is from age to age, *
    - on those who fear him.

    He puts forth his arm in strength *
    - and scatters the proud hearted.
    He casts the mighty from their thrones *
    - and raises the lowly.

    He fills the starving with good things, *
    - send the rich away empty.

    He protects Israel, his servant, *
    - remembering his mercy,
    the mercy promised to our fathers, *
    - to Abraham and his sons forever.
