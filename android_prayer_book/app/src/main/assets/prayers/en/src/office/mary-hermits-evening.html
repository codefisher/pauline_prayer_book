<h2>Evening Prayer</h2>

<reading label="Hymn"></reading>

<psalm>
    Star of sea and ocean,
    gateway to man's haven,
    mother of our Maker,
    hear our pray'r, O Maiden.

    Welcoming the <em>Ave</em>
    of God's simple greeting
    you have borne a Saviour
    far beyond all dreaming.

    Loose the bonds that hold us
    bound in sin's own blindness
    that with eyes now open'd
    God's own light may guide us.

    Show yourself our mother
    he will hear your pleading
    whom your womb has sheltered
    and whose hand brings healing.

    Gentlest of all virgins,
    that our love be faithful
    keep us from all evil
    gentle, strong, and grateful.

    Guard us through life's dangers
    never turn and leave us,
    may our hope find harbor
    in the calm of Jesus.

    Sing to God our Father
    through the Son who saves us
    joyful in the Spirit
    everlasting praises.

    - there to práise the Lord’s náme.
    Thére were set the thrónes of júdgement *
    - of the hóuse of Dávid.

    For the péace of Jerúsalem práy: *
    - &lsquo;Péace be to your hómes!

    Blessed be the God and Father *

    - with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places.

    He chose us in him *
