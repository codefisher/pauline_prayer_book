<litany includeblank="includeblank">
    It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,
    always and everywhere to give you thanks,
    Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God,
    through Christ our Lord.

    For truly God and truly human,
    he was chosen by you as
    the one Mediator between you
    and the human family,
    always living to make intercession for us.

    In your wisdom and goodness
    the Blessed Virgin Mary, the Mother and companion of the Redeemer,
    was to have a maternal role in the Church:
    of intercession and pardon,
    of prayer and grace,
    of reconciliation and peace.

    The love that she bestows as a mother
    is entirely the gift of Christ, the one Mediator,
    from whom alone she received her power.

    Her children, in their trails and fears,
    turn with confidence to the Blessed Virgin,
    calling to her as Mother of mercy and handmaid of grace.

    In our joy we sing to your glory
    with all the choirs of Angels:

    Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
    Heaven and earth are full of your glory.
    Hosanna in the highest.
    Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
    Hosanna in the highest.
</litany>

<h2 class="rubric">Communion Antiphon  <span class="ref">Rev 22:17</span></h2>

<litany>
    Let the Spirit and the Bride say: Come.
    Let all who hear say: Come. Let all who thirst, come;
    let all who will, take the free gift of water of life.
</litany>

<h2 class="rubric">Prayer after Communion</h2>
<litany>
    Refreshed, Lord God,
    at the fountain of salvation,
    we prayer that by the power of this Sacrament
    and through the prayers of the Blessed Virgin
    we may be more closely united
    to Christ, the Mediator,
    and ever more faithfully enter into
    the mystery of redemption.
    Through Christ our Lord.
</litany>
