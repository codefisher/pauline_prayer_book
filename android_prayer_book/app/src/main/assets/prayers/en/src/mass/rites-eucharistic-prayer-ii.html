    99. Although it is provided with its own Preface (text with <a href="">music,</a>), this Eucharistic Prayer may also be used with other Prefaces, especially those that present an overall view of the mystery of salvation, such as the Common Prefaces.

<p class="noindent">
    <sp>V/</sp> The Lord be with you.<br />

    - Father most holy,
    through your beloved Son, Jesus Christ,
    your Word through whom you made all things,
    whom you sent as our Saviour and Redeemer,
    incarnate by the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin.

    Fulfilling your will and gaining for you a holy people,
    he stretched out his hands as he endured his Passion,
    so as to break the bonds of death and manifest
    - the resurrection.

    And so, with the Angels and all the Saints
    we declare your glory,
    as with one voice we acclaim:

    Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
    Heaven and earth are full of your glory.
    Hosanna in the highest.
    Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.

    The Priest, with hands extended, says:
</p>

<div aside="<span class='rubric'>PC</span>">
    <strong>You are indeed Holy, O Lord,</strong><br />
    <strong>the fount of all holiness.</strong>
</div>

<p class="rubric" number="101.">
    He joins his hands and, holding them extended over the offerings, says:
</p>

<div aside="<span class='rubric'>CC</span>">
    <strong>Make holy, therefore, these gifts, we pray, </strong><br/>
    <strong>by sending down your Spirit upon them like the dewfall,</strong>
</div>

<p class="rubric">
    He joins his hands <br/>
    and makes the Sign of the Cross once over the bread and the chalice together, saying:
</p>

<litany class="strong">
so that they may become for us
the Body and <span class="cross">â˜©</span> Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.
</litany>

<p class="rubric">
He joins his hands.
</p>

<p class="rubric" number="102.">
    In the formulas that follow, the words of the Lord should be pronounced clearly and distinctly, as the nature of these words requires.
</p>

<litany class="strong">
At the time he was betrayed
and entered willingly into his Passion,
</litany>

<p class="rubric">
He takes the bread <br/>
and, holding it slightly raised above the altar, continues:
</p>

<litany class="strong">
    he took bread and, giving thanks, broke it,
    and gave it to his disciples, saying:
</litany>

<p class="rubric">
He bows slightly.
</p>

<litany class="strong">
    TAKE THIS, ALL OF YOU, AND EAT OF IT,
    FOR THIS IS MY BODY,
    WHICH WILL BE GIVEN UP FOR YOU.
</litany>

<p class="rubric">
He shows the consecrated host to the people, places it again on the paten, and genuflects in adoration.
</p>

<p class="rubric" number="103.">
    After this, he continues:
</p>

<litany class="strong">
    In a similar way, when supper was ended,
</litany>

<p class="rubric">
    He takes the chalice <br />
    and, holding it slightly raised above the altar, continues:
</p>

<litany class="strong">
    he took the chalice
    and, once more giving thanks,
    he gave it to his disciples, saying:
</litany>

<p class="rubric">
    He bows slightly.
</p>

<litany class="strong" includeblank="includeblank">
    TAKE THIS, ALL OF YOU, AND DRINK FROM IT,
    FOR THIS IS THE CHALICE OF MY BLOOD,
    THE BLOOD OF THE NEW AND ETERNAL COVENANT,
    WHICH WILL BE POURED OUT FOR YOU AND FOR MANY
    FOR THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS.

    DO THIS IN MEMORY OF ME.
</litany>

<p class="rubric">
    He shows the chalice to the people, places it on the corporal, and genuflects in adoration.
