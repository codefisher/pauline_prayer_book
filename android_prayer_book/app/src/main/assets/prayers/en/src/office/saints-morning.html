<h2>Morning Prayer</h2>

<reading label="Hymn"></reading>

<!-- http://www.preces-latinae.org/thesaurus/Hymni/Salutis.html -->

<psalm>
    Giver of life, eternal Lord,
    Thy own redeemed defend;
    Mother of grace, thy children save,
    and help them to the end.

    Ye thousand thousand Angel hosts,
    assist us in our need;
    Ye Patriarchs, with the Prophet choir,
    for our forgiveness plead.

    Forerunner blest, and Thou who still
    dost heaven's dread keys retain;
    Ye glorious Apostles all,
    unloose our guilty chain.

    Army of Martyrs, holy Priests,
    in beautiful array;
    Ye happy troops of Virgins chaste,
    wash all our stains away.

    All ye who high above the stars
    in heavenly glory reign,
    May we through your prevailing prayers
    unto your joys attain.

    Praise, honor, to the Father be,
    praise to His only Son;
    Praise, Holy Paraclete, to Thee,
    while endless ages run.
</psalm>

    On my béd I remémber yóu. *
    - On yóu I múse through the níght

    one God, for ever and ever.
