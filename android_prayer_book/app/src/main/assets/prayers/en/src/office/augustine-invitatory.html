<h1 class="index"><span class="rubric">August 28</span> <br />Saint Augustine, <br /> Bishop and Doctor of the Church</h1>

<h2><span class="rubric">Feast</span></h2>

<p><em>
    Born at Thagaste in Africa in the year 354. As a young man he led an unsettled life both in the philosophy he professed and in his moral behaviour, but later in the year 387, he was converted and received baptism at Milan from the bishop Saint Ambrose. He came back to his own country and led the life of an ascetic. Elected Bishop of Hippo, for thirty-four years he was an exemplary bishop to his flock, teaching his people by his sermons and writings, striving to combat the errors of the time and to make the faith understood. He died in the year 430.

    Psalm 94 (95)
</p>

<psalm>
    Come, ríng out our jóy to the Lórd; *
    - háil the Gód who sáves us.
    Let us cóme before him, gíving thánks, *
    - with sóngs let us háil the Lórd.&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>

    A míghty Gód is the Lórd, *
    - a gréat king abóve all góds.
    In his hánd are the dépths of the éarth; *
    - the héights of the móuntains are hís.
    To hím belongs the séa, for he máde it *
    - and the drý land sháped by his hánds.&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>

    Come ín; let us bów and bend lów; *
    - let us knéel before the Gód who máde us:
    for hé is our Gód and wé +
    - the péople who belóng to his pásture, *
    - the flóck that is léd by his hánd.&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>

    O that todáy you would lísten to his vóice! +
    - &lsquo;Hárden not your héarts as at Meríbah, *
    - as on that dáy at Mássah in the désert
    when your fáthers pút me to the tést; *
    - when they tríed me, thóugh they saw my wórk.&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>

    For forty yéars I was wéaried of these péople +
    - and I sáid: &ldquo;Their héarts are astráy, *
    - these péople do not knów my wáys.&rdquo;
    Thén I took an óath in my ánger: *
    - &ldquo;Néver shall they énter my rést.&rdquo; &rsquo;&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>

    Glory be to the Father and to the Son *
    - and to the Holy Spirit,
    as it was in the beginning, +
    - is now, and ever shall be, *
    - world without end. Amen.
