        For the grace that has called us the sons of St. Paul the First Hermit, to serve the People of God
        For the grace that in the most difficult moments, as the Mother of Mercy, you have sustained the very existence of the Order, by showing your unfailing help,
        For the grace, that there are always among us your saintly servants,
