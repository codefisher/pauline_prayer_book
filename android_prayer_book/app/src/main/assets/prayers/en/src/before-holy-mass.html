    <h2>4.1 Prayer of St. Ambrose</h2>

    <p>
        My kind Lord Jesus Christ, I, sinner that I am, approach
        the delights of your banquet in fear and trembling, not presuming
        on my own merits but relying upon your merciful goodness. Many
        a sin defiles me, body and soul; I am guilty of many an unguarded
        thought and word. O gracious Deity, awesome Majesty, I take ref-
        uge under your protection; I fly to you to be healed; I, a wretch
        caught in my oppression, appeal to you who are the very source of
        pity. I long for your coming, my Saviour; but if you come as Judge
        I cannot face you. Before you, Lord, I uncover my wounds; before
        you I lay bare my shame. My sins, I know, are many and grievous;
        they fill me with fear, but my hope is in your countless mercies.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lord Jesus Christ, eternal king, God-man crucified for
        man, turn your merciful gaze upon me and heed my prayer, for in
        you I put my trust. Have mercy upon me! I am all misery and sin,
        but you are an inexhaustible well of compassion. Hail, saving Vic-
        tim, offered up for me and for all mankind upon the gibbet of the
        cross! Hail, noble and precious blood, flowing from the wounds of
        my crucified Lord Jesus Christ and washing away the sins of the
        whole world!
    </p>

    <p>
        Remember, Lord, your creature whom you have ransomed
        with your blood. I am sorry for my sins, and long to make amends.
        All-merciful Father, take away from me all my sins and iniquities,
        make me clean in soul and body, and give me grace to partake wor-
        thily of your Holy of Holies.
    </p>

    <p>
        Grant that this holy sacrifice of your body and blood,
        which I am preparing to offer up, and of which, though unworthy, I
        mean to partake, may accomplish the remission of my sins, wash
        my guilt away entirely, banish evil thoughts, revive my better im-
        pulses, incite me to perform works pleasing to you for my own
        good, and prove the strongest of defences, keeping me safe in body
        and soul from the wiles of my enemies. Amen.
    </p>

    <h2>4.2 Prayer of St. Thomas Aquinas</h2>

    <p>
        Almighty, everlasting God, behold, I approach the sacra-
        ment of your Only-begotten Son, our Lord Jesus Christ. I come to
        it as a sick man to the physician who will save his life, as a man
        unclean to the fountain of mercy, a blind man to the radiance of
        eternal light, one poor and needy to the Lord of heaven and earth;
        praying that in your boundless generosity You will deign to cure
        my sickness, wash my defilement away, enlighten my blindness,
        enrich my poverty, and clothe my nakedness.
    </p>

    <p>
        May the Bread of Angels, the King of kings and Lord
        of lords, be received by me with such humble reverence and devout
        contrition, such faith and purity, and such good resolutions as may
        help the salvation of my soul. Grant me grace, I beseech You, to
        receive not only the sacrament of our Lord’s Body and Blood, but
        also its inward power and effect. All-gentle God, grant that my
        receiving of that Body, taken from the Virgin Mary’s womb by your
        Only-begotten Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, may fit me to become
        part of his Mystical Body and to be reckoned one of its members.
    </p>

    <p>
        Most loving Father, grant that your beloved Son whom I,
        an earthly wayfarer, am now to receive in his sacramental guise,
        may one day give me sight of his face and let me gaze upon Him
        for all eternity; who is God, living and reigning with You in the
        unity of the Holy Spirit for ever and ever. Amen.
    </p>

    <h2>4.3 Prayer to Our Lady</h2>

    <p>
        O Mother of pity and loving kindness, most blessed Virgin
        Mary, I, a worthless and wretched sinner, fly to you in heartfelt
        love and confidence, entreating your compassion. You who stood
        by your dear Son when He hung upon the cross, have pity and deign
        to stand by me too, wretched sinner that I am, and by all the priests
        who are offering Mass this day, here and elsewhere throughout
        his Holy Church.
    </p>
    <p>
        By the help of your favour enable us to offer a sacri-
        fice that shall be worthy and acceptable in the sight of the most
        high and undivided Trinity. Amen.
    </p>

    <h2>4.4 The Priest’s Declaration of Purpose before Mass</h2>

    <p>
        My purpose is to celebrate Mass and to consecrate the
        Body and Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ according to the rite of the
        Holy Roman Church, to the praise of Almighty God and of the
        whole Church triumphant in heaven, for my own welfare and that
        of the whole Church militant on earth, for all who have com-
        mended themselves to my prayers.
    </p>

    <p>
        May joy and peace, amendment of life, room for true
        penitence, the grace and comfort of the Holy Spirit, and steadfast-
        ness in good works be granted us by the Almighty and merciful
        Lord. Amen.
    </p>

    <h2>4.5 Preface of the Holy Eucharist</h2>

    <p>
        Father, all-powerful and ever-living God, we do well al-
        ways and everywhere to give you thanks through Jesus Christ our
        Lord. At the last supper, as He sat at table with his Apostles, He
        offered Himself to You as the spotless Lamb, the acceptable gift that
        gives You perfect praise. Christ has given us this memorial of his
        passion to bring us its saving power until the end of time. In this
        great Sacrament you feed your people and strengthen them in holi-
        ness, so that the family of mankind may come to walk in the light
        of one faith, in one communion of love. Amen.
    </p>

    <h2>4.6 Prayer to St. Joseph</h2>

    <p>God, who has conferred upon us a royal priesthood, we
        pray to you give us grace to minister at your holy altar with hearts
        as clean and lives as blameless as that of blessed Joseph, who was
        found worthy to hold in his arms and, with all reverence, to carry
        You the only-begotten Son, born of the Virgin Mary. Enable us this
        day to receive worthily the sacred Body and Blood of your Son,
        and enable us to win an everlasting reward in the world to come;
        through the same Christ our Lord. Amen.
