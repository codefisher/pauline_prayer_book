    Hermit</h1>


<h2 id="norm1">Norm 1</h2>


<ol class="arabic">
    <li> The Australian Province of the Order of St. Paul the Frist Hermit was established during
        the General Chapter of the Order at Jasna Gora (Częstochowa – 18<sup>th</sup> Feb-
        1<sup>st</sup> Mar 2008). The Australian Province encompasses all Pauline monasteries and
        houses which are actually on the territory of Australia as well as any new houses to be
        erected in the future in the territories of Australia and Oceania.
    </li>

    <li> The Mother House of the Australian Province is the monastery at Penrose Park.</li>

    <li> The legal title of the Australian Province of the Order of St. Paul the Frist Hermit shall
        be “The Trustees of the Pauline Fathers and Brothers, ‘being the corporate name under the
        Roman Catholic Church Communities’ Lands act of 1942.
    </li>

    <li> The goal of the Australian Province is to carry out apostolic and missionary activities of
        the Order of St. Paul the First Hermit as part of the Roman Catholic Church in Australia and
        Oceania. This goal is fulfilled through:
        <ul>

                particular law.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li> The Australian Province is open to the needs of the Local Church with special consideration
        for her multicultural and multinational character.
    </li>

    <li> The Provisions contained in the Code of Canon Law, the Constitutions and the General
        Directory of the Order of St. Paul the First Hermit, the Statutes of the Australian
        Provinces and the Local Church Law are to be observed in the life and activities of the
        Provinces.
    </li>

    <li> All members of the Provinces are obligated to care for new priestly and religious vocations
        and to take responsibility for their spiritual upbringing and intellectual education.
    </li>

    <li> The Australian Province is to provide financial assistance in favour of the Order, in an
        amount specified by the Superior General.
    </li>

    <li> In criminal cases of sexual, physical and the emotional abuse of minors, the Australian
        Province accepts the regulation of the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference and the
        Australian Conference of Leaders of Religious Institutes defined in the document “Towards
        Healing.”
    </li>


</ol>

<h2 id="norm2">Norm 2</h2>


<ol class="arabic">
    <li> The Administrative Board of the Province are the Provincial Chapter and the Father
        Provincial with the Provincial Definitorium.
    </li>

    <li> The authority of the Superior General extends over the whole Province as well as to each of
        its parts – monasteries, houses and individuals. His authority includes that of commanding
        and leading the Province in matters both spiritual and material in accordance with the
        regulations of Church Law, the Constitutions and the General Directory of the Order. (cf.
        <a href="general-officers.html#art116" ebook="ebook">Art. 116</a>)
    </li>


</ol>

<h2>Norm 3 The Provincial Chapter</h2>


<ol class="arabic">
    <li><p>The Electoral Provincial Chapter takes place every three years in a place and at the time
        designated by the Father Provincial with his Council with prior approval of the Superior
        General, who himself or by his delegate, has a right to participate in it. The Chairman of
        the Provincial Chapter, up until its conclusion, will be the Superior General or his
        delegate. (cf. <a href="provinces-order.html#art138" ebook="ebook">Art. 138</a>; <a href="general-provincial-chapters.html#norm138" ebook="ebook">Norm 138</a> and <a href="general-provincial-chapters.html#norm142" ebook="ebook">Norm 142</a>)</p>


        <p>
            Notification informing the place and time of the commencement of the Chapter should be
            given in writing two months prior to the beginning of the Chapter.
        </p>

    </li>

    <li> The time of convening Provincial Chapters should not conflict with times set for the
        General Chapters. (cf. <a href="general-provincial-chapters.html#norm138" ebook="ebook">Norm 138</a>)
    </li>

    <li> All religious who belong to the Province and are solemnly professed have both active and
        passive voice in the election of delegates. Seminarians who are solemnly professed but have
        not yet been ordained to the Holy Orders of Presbyterate only have an active vote.
    </li>

    <li> Those who by virtue of some other reasons have a voice at the General Chapter do not have
        either an active or passive voice in the election of delegates. The same is true of those
        who according to the universal law and Constitutions of the Order have been stripped of such
        a voice, Among these are the following religious:
        <ol class="alph">
            <li> Those who have received an indult of secularization or exclaustration and those who
                have already submitted a petition for one of these indults;
            </li>
            <li> Those who by reasons of sanctions have been stripped of active or passive voice.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li> During the Provincial Chapter should be elected the Provincial, four Provincial Definitors
        (of whom one can be a religious Brother) and Provincial Administrator. The Provincial
        Secretary is nominated by Provincial with the consent of the Provincial Definitorium. A
        religious Brother cannot fill the Office of the Vicar of the Province.
    </li>

    <li> The Provincial Chapter has the right to call on advisers and experts who do not take part
        in the elections. They can participate in debates only and at such time when they are
        presenting their opinions.
        <ol class="alph">
            <li> Members of the Provincial Chapter are the following:
            <li> The Superior General or his Delegate;</li>
            <li> The Father Provincial with the Provincial Definitorium;</li>
            <li> Delegates of the whole Province chosen according to our religious law should be at
                least the same number as those who take part in the Chapter by virtue of the Law
                itself.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            If the number of religious in the province is too small so as to select a sufficient
            number of delegates i.e. lower then 30, then all authorised members of the Province
            participate in the Provincial Chapter.
        </p>

    </li>


    <li> For serious reasons associated with the Province, the Father Provincial has the authority
        to call an Extraordinary Chapter with the consent of the Provincial Definitorium. An
        Extraordinary Chapter must be called if at least two-thirds of the authorised electors of
        the Province so demand in writing from the Father Provincial. However always with the
        consent of the Superior General and his Definitorium.
    </li>

    <li> The deliberations, discussions, voting and conclusion of the Provincial Chapter is subject
        to the same laws which bind the General Chapter, with the exception of all those details
        which are proper to the General Chapter. (cf. <a href="general-provincial-chapters.html#norm141" ebook="ebook">Norm 141</a>)
    </li>

    <li> If the vote during the Provincial Chapter is to be deemed valid then the presence of a
        majority of the Province’s voting members is necessary.
    </li>

    <li> The following falls within the competence of the Provincial Electoral Chapter:
        <ol class="alph">
            <li> Acceptance of reports with regards to the activities of the Father Provincial and
                the provincial Definitorium as well as ratification of the financial report of the
                Province;
            </li>
            <li> The Election of the Father Provincial and the Provincial Definitorium as well as
                the Provincial Administrator and Secretary according to the same precepts which bind
                during the General Chapter in the election of these same officers. (cf. <a href="general-provincial-chapters.html#norm142" ebook="ebook">Norm 142</a>);
            </li>
            <li> Voting on suggestions of changes in the Statutes of the Province;</li>
            <li> Establishing the financial levy to be applied to monasteries and houses in favour
                of the Province Fund;
            </li>
            <li> Consideration and regulation of matters in relation to the Province deferring to
                the competence of the General Chapter and the General Authority of the Order.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li><p>In the election of the Father Provincial and members of the Provincial Definitorium we
        are governed by an absolute majority. (cf. Can 199, §1) If there have been two inconclusive
        scrutinies, or even the third, a fourth vote is to be taken between the two candidates, who
        in the third vote received the greatest number of votes. If they received the same number of
        votes the elected should be considered the one who is older in first profession, if they
        have the same date of profession, then senior by age.</p>

        <p>
            The Principle of Seniority of Profession, according to the tradition of our Order,
            concerns all elections in the Order.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li> Concerning the introduction of necessary changes in the Provincial Statutes authorisation
        is required by the General Chapter or the Superior General with the consent of his
        Definitorium. Request for such a change is submitted by the Provincial Chapter with at least
        the two-thirds agreement of its members. (cf. <a href="constitutions.html#art197" ebook="ebook">Art. 197</a>)
    </li>

    <li> All voting is confidential unless the Provincial Chapter establishes otherwise deferring to
        the regulation of the Code of Canon Law and the constitutions of the Order.
    </li>

    <li> All the decisions of the Provincial Chapter are binding when they have been approved by the
        Superior General and his Definitorium and are pronounced by the Father Provincial. (cf. <a href="general-provincial-chapters.html#norm142" ebook="ebook">Norm
            142</a>)
    </li>

    <li> The Secretary records all resolutions made during the Chapter. Following the Chapter’s
        approval the Chairman, the Father Provincial and the Secretary sign such resolutions. A copy
        is handed to the Superior General, in his absence a copy of the said document is sent to
        him.
    </li>


</ol>

<h2>Norm 4 Election of Delegates</h2>


<ol class="arabic">
    <li> The Father Provincial together with the Provincial Definitorium establishes electoral
        colleges, determining the place and date of the elections as well as appoints the Chairman
        of the Electoral College. (cf. <a href="general-provincial-chapters.html#norm112" ebook="ebook">Norm 112</a>) If the number of eligible voters of the Province
        comprises between 30-50 religious then the election of the delegates’ proceeds in the
        following way:
        <ol class="alph">
            <li> Every group of Fathers and Brother numbering three members have the right to select
                one delegate and his substitute.
            </li>
            <li> Sufficiently large monasteries form one or a few colleges. The formation of these
                colleges is determined and bounded according to order and time of profession. When
                the number of Fathers of a given house does not allow for the formation of their own
                college, of if in another monastery the remaining number is insufficient to form a
                full college, then they should be included into another college, nominated by the
                Provincial Council. If in such a case a college will be enlarged, numbering five
                members, two delegates with their substitutes should be chosen (if 4 – 1). The
                chairman of each Electoral College is usually the local Prior or a Father appointed
                by the Provincial Council.
            </li>
            <li> Religious who are members of the Provincial Council by virtue of the law do not
                have an active or passive voice in the election of delegates.
            </li>
            <li> Delegates are elected by a confidential ballot with an absolute majority of votes.
                The same procedure is used for choosing the substitute delegate.
            </li>
            <li> The chairman of each Electoral College will send the results of the elections in
                writing to the Provincial Council. This report should be signed by the Chairman,
                Secretary and the scrutineers.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li> Solemnly Professed Bothers form, if possible, their own electoral college. If the number of
        Brothers in the Province does not allow to form their own college, or the number of the
        remaining Brothers is not sufficient for forming the next full college, therefore they
        should be included in the Electoral College nominated by the Provincial Council. The
        Chairman of the electoral college of Brothers is appointed by the Provincial Council.
    </li>

    <li> Fathers and Brothers who are entitled to vote, but who are excused for justified reasons in
        taking part in the elections (the excuse must be approved and confirmed by the local
        Superior) are able to send their ballots through either Father or Brother or even by post.
        In such a case this should be done by including the ballot in a double sealed envelope. The
        inner envelope should contain the names of the delegates written on separate cards. This is
        the envelope which will be publicly handed over to the Chairman after the beginning of the
        elections and opened at the time of casting ballots under the direction of scrutineers.
    </li>

    <li> When the number of electoral voters – members of the Province exceed 50, then every group
        of Fathers and Brothers numbering five members have the right to select one delegate and his
        substitute.
    </li>


</ol>
