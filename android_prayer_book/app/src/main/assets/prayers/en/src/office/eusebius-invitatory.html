<h1 class="index"><span class="rubric">January 20</span> <br />Blessed Eusebius, <br /> Priest, Founder of the Order</h1>

<h2><span class="rubric">Feast</span></h2>

<p><em>
    Eusebius was born around 1200. He received Priestly orders and was made a Canon of the Cathedral
    of Esztergom. In the year 1216, after receiving the permission of his bishop, he began to live
    an eremitical life in the Pilis Mountains. In the year 1246, he renounced his Canonry, and lived
    with brother hermits near Pilisszántó. He founded a monastic community under the patronage of
    the Holy Cross. In the year 1256, the community elected him as the first Provincial of the
    Pauline Order.

<p class="ref">
    Psalm 94 (95)
</p>

<psalm>
    Come, ring out our joy to the Lord;
    - hail the God who saves us.
    Let us come before him, giving thanks,
    - with songs let us hail the Lord. <sp>R/</sp>

    A mighty God is the Lord,
    - a great king above all gods.
    In his hand are the depths of the earth;
    - the heights of the mountains are his.
    To him belongs the sea, for he made it
    - and the dry land shaped by his hands. <sp>R/</sp>

    Come in; let us bow and bend low;
    - let us kneel before the God who made us:
    for he is our God and we
    - the people who belong to his pasture,
    - the flock that is led by his hand. <sp>R/</sp>

    O that today you would listen to his voice!
    - &lsquo;Harden not your hearts as at Meribah,
    - as on that day at Massah in the desert
    when your fathers put me to the test;
    - when they tried me, though they saw my work. <sp>R/</sp>

    For forty years I was wearied of these people
    - and I said: &ldquo;Their hearts are astray,
    - these people do not know my ways.&rdquo;
    Then I took an oath in my anger:
    - &ldquo;Never shall they enter my rest.&rdquo; &rsquo; <sp>R/</sp>

    Glory be to the Father and to the Son
    - and to the Holy Spirit,
    as it was in the beginning,
    - is now, and ever shall be,
    - world without end. Amen.
</psalm>
