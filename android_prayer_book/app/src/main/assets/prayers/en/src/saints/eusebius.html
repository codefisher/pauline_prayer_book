<p><em>
    Eusebius was born around 1200. He received Priestly orders and was made a Canon of the Cathedral
    of Esztergom. In the year 1216, after receiving the permission of his bishop, he began to live
    an eremitical life in the Pilis Mountains. In the year 1246, he renounced his Canonry, and lived
    with brother hermits near Pilisszántó. He founded a monastic community under the patronage of
    the Holy Cross. In the year 1256, the community elected him as the first Provincial of the
    Pauline Order.
