<h2 class="index">The General of the Order</h2>


<h2 id="art114">Article 114</h2>

<p>
    The foundation for the inner unity of every Religious Community is above all Christ who lives
    within that Community and who imparts Himself to it. He becomes the highest rule of life and the
    way to full development. The sign of external unity is the Superior General who takes the place
    of God and is united with the Apostolic See. All members are subject to the General in faith and
    fulfil their service to the Church under his direction.
</p>
<p>
    In like manner, the Pauline Community relates to the highest Superior of the Order with an
    attitude of faith. He is the one together with Christ who becomes the foundation for unity, is
    the head of the Order and its official representative. It is under his leadership that the Order
    fulfils its mission in the Church.
</p>

<h2 id="art115">Article 115</h2>

<p>
    The highest Superior of the Order, namely the Father-General, is chosen at Electoral Chapter.
    His term of office extends to the following General Electoral Chapter to which he is able to be
    elected a second time. He is not eligible for election for a third consecutive term. Beside the
    conditions laid down in Canon Law he must be forty years of age and ten years solemnly
    professed.
</p>

<h2 id="art116">Article 116</h2>

<p>
    The authority of the Father-General extends to the entire Order as well as to each of its parts:
    provinces, monasteries and individuals. His authority includes that of commanding and leading
    the entire Order in matters both spiritual and material in accordance with the Rules of Canon
    law, the Constitutions and the Directory.
</p>


<h2 id="art117">Article 117</h2>

<p>
    The Father General should be distinguished by a great love for obedience to and loyalty to the
    Church and the Holy See. It should be his concern that the Monastic Community be truly dedicated
    to the Church. Consequently, it will be his concern to inform the entire Order as to decrees,
    recommendations and documents coming forth from the Holy See especially those which concern
    religious life. At the required time he will also submit a report to the Apostolic See regarding
    the status and life of the Order (Can. 592 §. 2).
</p>
<p>
    It is his obligation also to see that all observe the decrees of the Episcopal Conference
    according to precepts of law.
</p>


<h2 id="art118">Article 118</h2>

<p>
    The Father General should further distinguish himself by a great love for the Order which is
    seen not only in his fervent prayer for its development but also in his concern for unity and
    charity among the members of the Order, the cultivation of new vocations, concern for solid
    formation of young Monks, as well as by faithfulness to our vocation, the living out of the
    Evangelical Counsels and concern for our mission and especially the preservation of its Marian
    character.
</p>


<h2 id="art119">Article 119</h2>

<p>
    In more serious matters, especially those defined by law, the Father General makes decisions
    together with the Definitorium. He takes care of material matters through the
    administrator-General in accordance with the Constitutions and the articles of Universal Law.
</p>


<h2 id="art120">Article 120</h2>

<p>
    In his concern for the good of the Order and its development, the Father General calls together
    and supports those commissions already existing and to whose competence fall matters regarding
    religious life and the activities of the Order.
</p>


<h2 id="art121">Article 121</h2>

<p>
    In his concern for executing the mission of the Order in the Church, the Father General should
    conduct a visitation of all our Houses either personally or through a delegate at least twice
    during his tenure of office. Each year he will call for a report from Provincials and Priors as
    to the state of the Province and individual Houses according to a previously compiled
    questionnaire.
</p>

<h2 id="art122">Article 122</h2>

<p>
    The Father General is able to grant a temporary dispensation from any statutes of the
    Constitutions which concern solely religious discipline. This applies to communities as well as
    to individuals. In agreement with the Definitorium, it is within his competence to set forth
    practical explanations of specific rules as well as to issue decrees concerning persons,
    monasteries or material goods. By the very manner of his personal life he should encourage all
    members to a faithful observance of the Constitutions.
</p>


<h2 id="art123">Article 123</h2>

<p>
    The permanent residence of the Father General during his term of office is the principal
    Monastery of our Order as Jasna Gora, in Częstochowa, unless the General Chapter decides
    otherwise giving due notification to the Apostolic See.
</p>


<h2 id="art124">Article 124</h2>

<p>
    Mindful of the position of the Father General and the burden of his responsibilities, all our
    Monks should strive to make his burden easier and in the spirit of charity support him through
    prayer, respect, obedience and cooperation.
</p>


<h2 id="art125">Article 125</h2>

<p>
    In accordance with the ancient tradition of the Order, the Father General can after hearing the
    opinions of the Definitorium to receive either clergy or laity into the “Confraternity” as a way
    of expressing to them gratitude for their kindnesses or as a way of giving them greater
    participation in the Order. All this accordance, following statutes which concern this matter.
</p>
<p>
    It is also advisable that the Father General should gather around the Order a group of
    individuals, clergy as well as lay, for the purpose of making even more effective our apostolic
    works.
</p>
<p>
    The Father General can grant special recognition in the form of diplomas to deserving
    individuals-all in accordance with the appropriate statutes governing this matter.
</p>

<h2 class="index">The Vicar of the Order</h2>


<h2 id="art126">Article 126</h2>

<p>
    The Vicar of the Order is the first Definitor. He is also the one who takes the place of the
    Father General and is his closest collaborator. He should be at least ten years in Solemn
    Profession. His cooperation with the General has as its goal the good of the entire Order. This
    is seen in his willing service to the Father General, by his sincere counsel, by his suggesting
    new initiatives, and in executing the orders of the Father General and if the need arises even
    admonishing him out of a spirit of charity and respect.
</p>


<h2 id="art127">Article 127</h2>

<p>
    The Vicar of the Order is a man in whom both the Father General and the whole Monastic Community
    place their trust as well as each confrere, then should have easy access to him in matters
    pertaining to both the Monastic Family as well as personal.
</p>

    governing the Order.
</p>
<p>
    More serious matters should be postponed until the General returns unless
    there be a serious urgency for their immediate resolution. If for whatever reason the office of
    Father General becomes vacant, the Vicar of the Order carries on the affairs of the Order and
    convenes a General Elective Chapter within three months in accordance with our law.
</p>
<p>
    In the event of the death of the Father-General, the Vicar’s responsibility is to call the whole
    Order to offer prayer for the peace of his soul.
</p>
<p>
    As the Vicar assumes leadership of the Order during this time, he should keep in mind the style
    and the thinking of the deceased Father General as he sets about his task.

    electoral chapter. Their office lasts until the next electoral chapter. A religious brother

    The role of the Definitors is to co-operate with the Father General in the Governance of the
    Order, assisting him with council and their evangelical attitude. That is why they should be
    distinguished by their zeal, prudence and their sense of responsibility for the growth and
    mission of the Order. They should not be entrusted with offices that are not compatible with
