<h2>Evening Prayer II</h2>

<reading label="Hymn"></reading>

<psalm>
    Paul, who off in distant lands,
    The crowd and clamour avoided,
    Dared to live in woods and forests,
    Dwelling in an obscure cavern.

    Lone out there you fought and won
    O’er the monstrous creatures of hell,
    Teaching us to gain the relish
    All the joys of peace of soul.

    Winner of the heavenly city,
    Disregard not the prayers
    Of those who devoutly sing to you
    With hymns of praise.

    May our lives be free from sin,
    Virtue and piety dwelling there.
    May our hearts forever reflect
    Divine peace, light, and glory.

    Glory be to the Father,
    Glory to the only begotten,
    Glory to the loving Spirit,
    May we join with Paul God’s glory.
</psalm>

    Lord, whó shall be admítted to your tént *

    Hé who wálks without fáult; *

    hé who keeps his plédge, come what máy; +

    - and accépts no bríbes against the ínnocent.
    Such a mán will stand fírm for éver.

    Happy the mán who féars the Lórd, *
    - who tákes delíght in all his commánds.
    His sóns will be pówerful on éarth; *
    - the chíldren of the úpright are bléssed.

    Ríches and wéalth are in his hóuse; *
    - his jústice stands fírm for éver.
    He is a líght in the dárkness for the úpright: *
    - he is génerous, mérciful and júst.

    The góod man takes píty and lénds, *
    - he condúcts his affáirs with hónour.
    The júst man will néver wáver: *
    - hé will be remémbered for éver.

    He has no féar of évil néws; *
    - with a fírm heart he trústs in the Lórd.
    With a stéadfast héart he will not féar; *
    - he will sée the dównfall of his fóes.

    Open-hánded, he gíves to the póor; +

    - His héad will be ráised in glóry.

    The wícked man sées and is ángry, +

    - the desíre of the wícked leads to dóom.

<p>
    But because of Christ, I have come to consider all these advantages that I had as disadvantages.
    Not only that, but I believe nothing can happen that will outweigh the supreme advantage of knowing
    Christ Jesus my Lord. For him I have accepted the loss of everything, and I look on everything
    as so much rubbish, if only I can have Christ.

    My soul glórifies the Lórd, *
    - my spirit rejóices in Gód, my Sáviour.
    He looks on his sérvant in her lówliness; *
    - henceforth all áges will cáll me bléssed.

    The Almíghty works márvels for me. *
    - Hóly his náme!
    His mércy is from age to áge, *
    - on thóse who féar him.

    He púts forth his árm in stréngth *
    - and scátters the proud-héarted.
    He casts the míghty from their thrónes *
    - and ráises the lówly.

    He fills the stárving with good thíngs, *

    He protects Ísrael, his sérvant, *

<litany>
    Confiding in Christ, the God-Man, we ask to serve him in holiness and justice. Let us call upon him saying: <br />  <sp>R/</sp> <em>You are the Holy One, Lord.</em>
    You, who wanted to undergo temptation to be as we are, yet without sinning;
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span> have mercy on us, Lord Jesus!&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>
    You, who wanted us to become the salt of the earth and the light of the world under the protection of Mary, Our Mother;
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span> enlighten us, Lord Jesus!&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>
    You, who came out not to be served but to serve;
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span> grant us to be your humble ministers to all men, our brothers!&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>
    You, who reflected the glory of God and bear the very stamp of his nature;
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span> grant us that living as a community, each one of us may give glory to God and draw young people to the service of your mother.&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>
    You, who abolished death through your death, and brought to us life and immortality;
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span> give eternal peace and rest to our dead brothers and benefactors.&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>

<litany>God, you granted that Saint Paul, our Father,
    achieve sanctity in the desert,
    grant through his intercession,
    that we, who are striving to develop
    in ourselves a spirit of prayer and service,
    may come ever closer to you in love.
    Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
    who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
    one God, for ever and ever.
