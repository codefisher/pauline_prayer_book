<h2>Evening Prayer II</h2>

<reading label="Hymn"></reading>

<psalm>
    Paul, who off in distant lands,
    The crowd and clamour avoided,
    Dared to live in woods and forests,
    Dwelling in an obscure cavern.

    Lone out there you fought and won
    O’er the monstrous creatures of hell,
    Teaching us to gain the relish
    All the joys of peace of soul.

    Winner of heavenly city,
    Disregard not the prayers
    Of those who devoutly sing to you
    With hymns of praise.

    May our lives be free from sin,
    Virtue and piety dwelling there.
    May our hearts forever reflect
    Divine peace, light and glory

    Glory be to the Father,
    Glory to the only begotten
    Glory to the loving Spirit
    May we join with Paul God’s glory
</psalm>

<p class="ref">Psalm 14 (15)</p>
<psalm>
    Lord, who shall be admitted to your tent *
    and dwell on your holy mountain?

    He who walks without fault ; *
    - he who acts with justice
    and speaks the truth from his heart; *
    - he does not slander with his tongue;

    He who does no wrong to his brother, *
    - who casts no slur on his neighbour,
    who holds the godless in disdain, *
    - but honours those who fear the Lord;

    He who keeps his pledge, come what may; †
    - who takes no interest on a loan *
    - and accepts no bribes against the innocent.
    Such a man will live for ever.

    <span class="rubric">Ant. 2:</span> Returning to the Lord and resting in Him, will be your salvation and your strength flows from hope.
</p>
<p class="ref">Psalm 111 (112)</p>
<psalm>
    Happy the man who fears the Lord, *
    - who takes delight in all his commands.
    His sons will be powerful on earth; *
    - the children of the upright are blessed.

    Riches and wealth are in his house; *
    - his justice stands firm forever.
    He is a light in the darkness for the upright: *
    - he is generous, merciful and just.

    The good man takes pity and lends, *
    - he conducts his affairs with honour.
    The just man will never waver: *
    - he will be remembered for ever.

    He has no fear of evil news; *
    - with a firm heart he trusts in the Lord.
    With a steadfast heart will not fear; *
    - he will see the downfall of his foes.

    Open-handed he gives to the poor; †
    - his justice stands firm for ever. *
    - his head will be raised in glory.

    The wicked man sees and is angry, †
    - grinds his teeth and fades away; *
    - the desire of the wicked leads to doom.

    Great and wonderful are your deeds, *
    - O Lord God the Almighty!
    Just and true are your ways, *

    Who shall not fear and glorify your name, O Lord? *
    - For you alone are holy.
    All nations shall come and worship, *
    - for your judgements have been revealed.

<reading label="Scripture Reading" ref="Phil 3:7-8"></reading>

<p>
    But because of Christ, I have come to consider all these advantages that I had as disadvantages.
    Not only that, but I believe nothing can happen that will outweigh the supreme advantage of knowing
    Christ Jesus my Lord. For him I have accepted the loss of everything, and I look on everything
    as so much rubbish if only I can have Christ.

<psalm>
    My soul glorifies the Lord, *
    - my spirit rejoices in God, my Saviour.
    He looks on his servant in her lowliness; *
    - henceforth all ages will call me blessed.

    The Almighty works marvels for me. *
    - Holy his name!
    His mercy is from age to age, *
    - on those who fear him.

    He puts forth his arm in strength *
    - and scatters the proud hearted.
    He casts the mighty from their thrones *
    - and raises the lowly.

    He fills the starving with good things, *
    - send the rich away empty.

    He protects Israel, his servant, *
    - remembering his mercy,
    the mercy promised to our fathers, *
    - to Abraham and his sons forever.

    Confiding in Christ, the God-Man, we ask to serve him in holiness and justice. Let us call upon him saying: <br />  <sp>R/</sp> <em>You are the Holy One, Lord.</em>
    You, who wanted to undergo temptation to be as we are, yet without sinning,
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span> have mercy on us, Lord Jesus! <sp>R/</sp>
    You, who wanted us to become the salt of the earth and the light of the world under the protection of Mary, Our Mother,
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span> enlighten us, Lord Jesus: <sp>R/</sp>
    You, who came out not to be served but to serve,
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span> grant us to be your humble ministers to all men, our brothers! <sp>R/</sp>
    You, who reflected the glory of God and bear the very stamp of his nature,
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span> grant us that, living as a community, each one of us may give glory to God and draw young people to the service of your mother: <sp>R/</sp>
    You, who abolished death through your death, and brought to us life and immortality,
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span> give eternal peace and rest to our dead brothers and benefactors: <sp>R/</sp>

<litany>God, you granted that Saint Paul, our Father,
    achieve sanctity in the desert,
    grant through his intercession,
    that we who are striving to develop
    in ourselves a spirit of prayer and service
    may come ever closer to you in love.
    Through our Lord Jesus Christ your Son,
    who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
    one God, for ever and ever.
