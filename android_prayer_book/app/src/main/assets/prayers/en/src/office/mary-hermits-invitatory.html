<p class="ref">
    Psalm 94 (95)
</p>

<psalm>
    Come, ring out our joy to the Lord;
    - hail the God who saves us.
    Let us come before him, giving thanks,
    - with songs let us hail the Lord. <sp>R/</sp>

    A mighty God is the Lord,
    - a great king above all gods.
    In his hand are the depths of the earth;
    - the heights of the mountains are his.
    To him belongs the sea, for he made it
    - and the dry land shaped by his hands. <sp>R/</sp>

    Come in; let us bow and bend low;
    - let us kneel before the God who made us:
    for he is our God and we
    - the people who belong to his pasture,
    - the flock that is led by his hand. <sp>R/</sp>

    O that today you would listen to his voice!
    - &lsquo;Harden not your hearts as at Meribah,
    - as on that day at Massah in the desert
    when your fathers put me to the test;
    - when they tried me, though they saw my work. <sp>R/</sp>

    For forty years I was wearied of these people
    - and I said: &ldquo;Their hearts are astray,
    - these people do not know my ways.&rdquo;
    Then I took an oath in my anger:
    - &ldquo;Never shall they enter my rest.&rdquo; &rsquo; <sp>R/</sp>

    Glory be to the Father and to the Son
    - and to the Holy Spirit,
    as it was in the beginning,
    - is now, and ever shall be,
    - world without end. Amen.
</psalm>
