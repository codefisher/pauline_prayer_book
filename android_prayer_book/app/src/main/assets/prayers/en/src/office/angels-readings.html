<h2>Office of Readings</h2>

<reading label="Hymn"></reading>

<psalm>
    Hark! hark, my soul! angelic songs are swelling
    o’er earth’s green fields and ocean’s wave-beat shore:
    how sweet the truth those blessed strains are telling
    of that new life when sin shall be no more.

    Onward we go, for still we hear them singing,
    ‘Come, weary souls, for Jesus bids you come’;
    and through the dark, its echoes sweetly ringing,
    the music of the gospel leads us home.

    Far, far away, like bells at evening pealing,
    the voice of Jesus sounds o’er land and sea;
    and laden souls, by thousands meekly stealing,
    kind Shepherd, turn their weary steps to thee.

    Rest comes at length: though life be long and dreary,
    the day must dawn, and darksome night be past;
    faith’s journeys end in welcome to the weary,
    and heaven, the heart’s true home, will come at last.

    Angels, sing on! your faithful watches keeping;
    sing us sweet fragments of the songs above,
    till morning’s joy shall end the night of weeping,
    and life’s long shadows break in cloudless love.
</psalm>

    Psalm 96 (97)
</p>
<psalm>
    The Lord is kíng, let éarth rejóice, *
    let áll the cóastlands be glád.
    Clóud and dárkness are his ráiment; *
    his thróne, jústice and ríght.

    A fíre prepáres his páth; *
    it búrns up his fóes on every síde.
    His líghtnings líght up the wórld, *
    the éarth trémbles at the síght.

    The móuntains mélt like wáx *
    before the Lórd of áll the éarth.
    The skíes procláim his jústice; *
    all péoples sée his glóry.

    Let thóse who serve ídols be ashámed, +
    those who bóast of their wórthless góds. *
    All you spírits, wórship hím.

    Síon héars and is glád; +
    the péople of Júdah rejóice *
    becáuse of your júdgements, O Lórd.

    For yóu indéed are the Lórd +
    most hígh above áll the éarth, *
    exálted far abóve all spírits.

    The Lórd loves thóse who hate évil; +
    he gúards the sóuls of his sáints; *
    he séts them frée from the wícked.

    Líght shines fórth for the júst *
    and jóy for the úpright of héart.
    Rejóice, you júst, in the Lórd; *
    give glóry to his hóly náme.

    My sóul, give thánks to the Lórd *
    all my béing, bléss his holy náme.
    My sóul, give thánks to the Lórd *
    and néver forgét all his bléssings.

    It is hé who forgíves all your gúilt, *
    who héals every óne of your ílls,

    The Lórd is compássion and lóve, *
    slow to ánger and rích in mércy.
    His wráth will cóme to an énd; *
    he will nót be ángry for éver.
    He does not tréat us accórding to our síns *
    nor repáy us accórding to our fáults.

    For as the héavens are hígh above the éarth *
    so stróng is his lóve for those who féar him.
    As fár as the éast is from the wést *
    so fár does he remóve our síns.

    As a fáther has compássion on his sóns, *
    the Lord has píty on thóse who féar him;
    for he knóws of whát we are máde, *
    he remémbers that wé are dúst.

<reading label="First Reading" ref="12:1-22"
         tagline="The Archangel Raphel the guardian of Tobias">A
    reading from the book of the Tobit
</reading>
<!-- Using the RSVCE translation -->
<p>
    Tobit then called his son Tobi′as and said to him, “My son, see to the wages of the man who went
    with you; and he must also be given more.”  He replied, “Father, it would do me no harm to give
    him half of what I have brought back.  For he has led me back to you safely, he cured my wife,
    he obtained the money for me, and he also healed you.”  The old man said, “He deserves it.”
    So he called the angel and said to him, “Take half of all that you two have brought back.”
</p>
<p>
    Then the angel called the two of them privately and said to them: “Praise God and give thanks to
    him; exalt him and give thanks to him in the presence of all the living for what he has done for
    you. It is good to praise God and to exalt his name, worthily declaring the works of God. Do not
    be slow to give him thanks.  It is good to guard the secret of a king, but gloriously to reveal
    the works of God. Do good, and evil will not overtake you.  Prayer is good when accompanied by
    fasting, almsgiving, and righteousness. A little with righteousness is better than much with
    wrongdoing. It is better to give alms than to treasure up gold.  For almsgiving delivers from
    death, and it will purge away every sin. Those who perform deeds of charity[b] and of
    righteousness will have fulness of life;  but those who commit sin are the enemies of their
    own lives.
</p>
<p>
    “I will not conceal anything from you. I have said, ‘It is good to guard the secret of a king,
    but gloriously to reveal the works of God.’  And so, when you and your daughter-in-law Sarah
    prayed, I brought a reminder of your prayer before the Holy One; and when you buried the dead, I
    was likewise present with you.  When you did not hesitate to rise and leave your dinner in
    order to go and lay out the dead, your good deed was not hidden from me, but I was with you.
    So now God sent me to heal you and your daughter-in-law Sarah. I am Raph′ael, one of the
    seven holy angels who present the prayers of the saints and enter into the presence of the glory
    of the Holy One.”
</p>
<p>
    They were both alarmed; and they fell upon their faces, for they were afraid. But he said to
    them, “Do not be afraid; you will be safe. But praise God for ever. For I did not come as a
    favor on my part, but by the will of our God. Therefore praise him for ever.  All these days I
    merely appeared to you and did not eat or drink, but you were seeing a vision.  And now give
    thanks to God, for I am ascending to him who sent me. Write in a book everything that has
    happened.”  Then they stood up; but they saw him no more.  So they confessed the great and
    wonderful works of God, and acknowledged that the angel of the Lord had appeared to them.

<reading label="Second Reading" longref="Sermon 12 on Ps 90"
         tagline="May they guard you in all your ways">A
    reading from the sermons of St Bernard
</reading>

<p>
    &lsquo;He has given his angels charge over you to guard you in all your ways.&rsquo; Let them thank the Lord for his mercy; his wonderful works are for the children of men. Let them give thanks and say among the nations, the Lord has done great things for them. O Lord, what is man that you have made yourself known to him, or why do you incline your heart to him? And you do incline your heart to him; you show him your care and your concern. Finally, you send your only Son and the grace of your Spirit, and promise him a vision of your countenance. And so, that nothing in heaven should be wanting in your concern for us, you send those blessed spirits to serve us, assigning them as our guardians and our teachers.
</p>
<p>
    &lsquo;He has given his angels charge over you to guard you in all your ways.&rsquo; These words should fill you with respect, inspire devotion and instil confidence; respect for the presence of angels, devotion because of their loving service, and confidence because of their protection. And so the angels are here; they are at your side, they are with you, present on your behalf. They are here to protect you and to serve you. But even if it is God who has given them this charge, we must nonetheless be grateful to them for the great love with which they obey and come to help us in our great need.
</p>
<p>
    So let us be devoted and grateful to such great protectors; let us return their love and honour them as much as we can and should. Yet all our love and honour must go to him, for it is from him that they receive all that makes them worthy of our love and respect.
</p>
<p>
    We should then, my brothers, show our affection for the angels, for one day they will be our co-heirs just as here below they are our guardians and trustees appointed and set over us by the Father. We are God’s children although it does not seem so, because we are still but small children under guardians and trustees, and for the present little better than slaves.
</p>
<p>
    Even though we are children and have a long, a very long and dangerous way to go, with such protectors what have we to fear? They who keep us in all our ways cannot be overpowered or led astray, much less lead us astray. They are loyal, prudent, powerful. Why then are we afraid? We have only to follow them, stay close to them, and we shall dwell under the protection of God’s heaven.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
    <sp>R/</sp> He has commanded his angels to keep you in all your ways; <span class="rubric">*</span> they shall bear you upon their hands lest you strike your foot against a stone.
    <br />
    <sp>V/</sp> Upon you no evil shall fall, no plague approach where you dwell; <span class="rubric">*</span> they shall bear you upon their hands lest you strike your foot against a stone.

<reading label="Hymn">Te Deum</reading>

<psalm>
    We praise you, O God: *
    we acclaim you as the Lord.

    - Everlasting Father, *
    - all the world bows down before you.

    All the angels sing your praise, *
    the hosts of heaven and all the angelic powers,

    - all the cherubim and seraphim *
    - call out to you in unending song:

    -- <em>Holy, Holy, Holy,</em> *
    -- <em>is the Lord God of angel hosts!</em>

    The heavens and the earth are filled *
    with your majesty and glory.

    - The glorious band of apostles, *
    - the noble company of prophets,

    the white-robed army who shed their blood for Christ, *
    all sing your praise.

    - And to the ends of the earth *
    - your holy Church proclaims her faith in you:

    -- Father, whose majesty is boundless, +
    -- your true and only Son, who is to be adored, *
    -- the Holy Spirit sent to be our Advocate.

    You, Christ, are the king of glory, *
    Son of the eternal Father.

    - When you took our nature to save mankind *
    - you did not shrink from birth in the Virgin’s womb.

    You overcame the power of death *
    opening the Father’s kingdom to all who believe in you.

    - Enthroned at God’s right hand in the glory of the Father, *
    - you will come in judgement according to your promise.

    You redeemed your people by your precious blood. *
    Come, we implore you, to our aid.

    - Grant us with the saints *
    - a place in eternal glory.

    <span class="instruction">The final part of the hymn may be omitted:</span>

    Lord, save your people *
    and bless your inheritance.

    - Rule them and uphold them *
    - for ever and ever.

    Day by day we praise you: *
    we acclaim you now and to all eternity.

    - In your goodness, Lord, keep us free from sin. *
    - Have mercy on us, Lord, have mercy.

    May your mercy always be with us, Lord, *
    for we have hoped in you.

    - In you, Lord, we put our trust: *
    - we shall not be put to shame.
