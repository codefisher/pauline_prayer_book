    O God, who to St Joseph, bishop,
    granted apostolic zeal and a devotion to the mystery of the Eucharist,
    grant we beseech you, that by his intercession,
    we may be abundantly fed with the bread of life
    and rejoice with the pledge of eternity.
    Through our Lord Jesus Christ your Son,
    who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
    one God, for ever and ever.
</litany>
