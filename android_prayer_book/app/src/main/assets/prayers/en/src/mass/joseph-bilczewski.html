<p><em>
    Joseph Bilczewski was born on the 26th of April 1860 in Wilamowice near KÄ™ty. He was the
    Archbishop of Lviv, the professor of Dogmatic Theology and the Rector of the Lviv University.
    He had great devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary, Queen of Poland. He believed her cult to be
    the greatest cause in the unification and rebirth of the Polish nation in the years of the
    Partitions of Poland.

<litany>
    O God, who to Saint Joseph, bishop,
    granted apostolic zeal and a devotion to the mystery of the Eucharist,
    grant, we beseech you, that through his intercession,
    we may be abundantly fed with the bread of life
    and rejoice with the pledge of eternity.
    Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
    who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
    one God, for ever and ever.
</litany>
