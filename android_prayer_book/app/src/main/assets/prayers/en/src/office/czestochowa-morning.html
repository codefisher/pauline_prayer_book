<h2>Morning Prayer</h2>

<reading label="Hymn"></reading>

<psalm>
    Mary, crowned with living light,
    Temple of the Lord,
    Place of peace and holiness,
    Shelter of the Word.

    Mystery of sinless life
    In our fallen race,
    Free from shadow you reflect
    Plenitude of grace.

    Virgin-mother of our God,
    Lift us when we fall,
    Who were named upon the Cross
    Mother of us all.

    Father, Son and Holy Ghost,
    Heaven sings your praise,
    Mary magnifies your name
    Through eternal days.
</psalm>

<p class="ref">Psalm 62 (63)</p>
<psalm>
    O God, you are my God, for you I long; *
    - for you my soul is thirsting.
    My body pines for you *
    - like a dry, weary land without water.

    So I gaze on you in the sanctuary *
    - to see your strength and your glory.
    For your love is better than life, *
    - my lips will speak your praise.

    So I will bless you all my life, *
    - in your name I will lift up my hands.
    My soul shall be filled as with a banquet, *
    - my mouth shall praise you with joy.

    On my bed I remember you. *
    - On you I muse through the night
    for you have been my help; *
    - in the shadow of your wings I rejoice.
    My soul clings to you; *
    - your right hand holds me fast.

<p class="ref">Psalm 149</p>

<psalm>
    Sing a new song to the Lord, *
    - his praise in the assembly of the faithful.
    Let Israel rejoice in its Maker, *
    - let Zionâ€™s sons exult in their king.
    Let them praise his name with dancing *
    - and make music with timbrel and harp.

    For the Lord takes delight in his people. *
    - He crowns the poor with salvation.
    Let the faithful rejoice in their glory, *
    - shout for joy and take their rest.
    Let the praise of God be on their lips *
    - and a two-edged sword in their hand,

    to deal out vengeance to the nations *
    - and punishment on all the peoples;
    to bind their kings in chains *
    - and their nobles in fetters of iron;
    to carry out the sentence pre-ordained: *
    - this honour is for all his faithful.

<psalm>
    Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel! *
    - He has visited his people and redeemed them.

    He has raised up for us a mighty saviour *
    - in the house of David his servant,
    as he promised by the lips of holy men, *
    - those who were his prophets from of old.

    A saviour who would free us from our foes, *
    - from the hands of all who hate us.
    So his love for our fathers is fulfilled *
    - and his holy covenant remembered.

    He swore to Abraham our father to grant us, *
    - that free from fear, and saved from the hands of our foes,
    we might serve him in holiness and justice *
    - all the days of our life in his presence.

    As for you, little child, *
    - you shall be called a prophet of God, the Most High.
    You shall go ahead of the Lord *
    - to prepare his ways before him,

    To make known to his people their salvation *
    - through forgiveness of all their sins,
    the loving-kindness of the heart of our God *
    - who visits us like the dawn from on high.

    He will give light to those in darkness, +
    - those who dwell in the shadow of death, *
    - and guide us into the way of peace.

    Sun of justice, you showed your day was dawning in the Immaculate Virgin Mary;
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span>help us to walk in the daylight of your presence. <sp>R/</sp>
    Eternal Word, in the living flesh of Mary you found a dwelling place on earth;
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span>remain with us for ever in hearts free from sin. <sp>R/</sp>
    Christ, our Saviour, you willed that your mother should be there when you died;
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span>through her intercession may we rejoice to share your suffering. <sp>R/</sp>
    Loving Saviour, while hanging on the cross, you gave your mother Mary to be the mother of John;

<litany>
    O Almighty and Merciful God,
    you have wondrously made the most Blessed Virgin Mary
    to be the perpetual help and defence of the Christian people,
    and made her holy image at Jasna Gora renowned by the solemn veneration of the faithful.
    Defended by her protection,
    as we fight the battle of life,
    may we be victorious over the evil spirits at the hour of our death.
    Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Your Son,
    who lives and reigns with You in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
    one God for ever and ever.
</litany>
