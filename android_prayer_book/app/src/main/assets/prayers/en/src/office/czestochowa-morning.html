<h2>Morning Prayer</h2>

<reading label="Hymn"></reading>

<psalm>
    Mary, crowned with living light,
    Temple of the Lord,
    Place of peace and holiness,
    Shelter of the Word.

    Mystery of sinless life
    In our fallen race,
    Free from shadow you reflect
    Plenitude of grace.

    Virgin-mother of our God,
    Lift us when we fall,
    Who were named upon the Cross
    Mother of us all.

    Father, Son and Holy Ghost,
    Heaven sings your praise,
    Mary magnifies your name
    Through eternal days.
</psalm>

<psalm>
    O Gód, you are my Gód, for you I lóng; *

    So I will bléss you áll my lífe, *
    - in your náme I will líft up my hánds.
    My sóul shall be fílled as with a bánquet, *
    - my móuth shall práise you with jóy.

    On my béd I remémber yóu. *
    - On yóu I múse through the níght

<litany>
    O Almighty and Merciful God,
    you have wondrously established the most Blessed Virgin Mary
    to be the perpetual help and defence of the Christian people,
    and made her holy image at Jasna Gora renowned
    by the solemn veneration of the faithful.
    Graciously grant that defended by her protection
    as we fight the battle of life,
    may we be victorious over the evil spirits at the hour of our death.
    Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Your Son,
    who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
    one God for ever and ever.
</litany>
