<h1 class="index"><span class="rubric">January 15</span> <br />Saint Paul the First Hermit <br /> Father of the Order</h1>

<h2><span class="rubric">Solemnity</span></h2>

<p><em>
    Paul was born around AD 228 in Thebes. When he was sixteen, the persecutions of Christians began. Hiding in the desert, he resolved to spend the rest of his life in solitude and in prayer.
</em></p>

<h2>Evening Prayer I</h2>

<reading label="Hymn"></reading>

<psalm>
    Paul, who off in distant lands,
    The crowd and clamour avoided,
    Dared to live in woods and forests,
    Dwelling in an obscure cavern.

    Lone out there you fought and won
    O’er the monstrous creatures of hell,
    Teaching us to gain the relish
    All the joys of peace of soul.

    Winner of the heavenly city,
    Disregard not the prayers
    Of those who devoutly sing to you
    With hymns of praise.

    May our lives be free from sin,
    Virtue and piety dwelling there.
    May our hearts forever reflect
    Divine peace, light, and glory.

    Glory be to the Father,
    Glory to the only begotten,
    Glory to the loving Spirit,
    May we join with Paul God’s glory.
</psalm>

<psalm>
    Práise, O sérvants of the Lórd, *
    - práise the náme of the Lórd!
    May the náme of the Lórd be bléssed *
    - both nów and for évermóre!
    From the rísing of the sún to its sétting *
    - práised be the náme of the Lórd!

    Hígh above all nátions is the Lórd, *
    - abóve the héavens his glóry.
    Whó is like the Lórd, our Gód, *
    - who has rísen on hígh to his thróne
    yet stóops from the héights to look dówn, *
    - to look dówn upon héaven and éarth?

    From the dúst he lífts up the lówly, *
    - from the dúngheap he ráises the póor
    to sét him in the cómpany of prínces, *
    - yés, with the prínces of his péople.
    To the chíldless wífe he gives a hóme *
    - and gláddens her héart with chíldren.

    My sóul, give práise to the Lórd; †
    - I will práise the Lórd all my dáys, *
    - make músic to my Gód while I líve.

    Pút no trúst in prínces, *
    - In mortal mén in whóm there is no hélp.
    Take their bréath, they retúrn to cláy *
    - and their pláns that dáy come to nóthing.

    He is háppy who is hélped by Jacob’s Gód,
    - whose hópe is in the Lórd his Gód, *
    who alóne made héaven and éarth, *
    - the séas and áll they contáin.

    It is hé who keeps fáith for éver, *
    - who is júst to thóse who are oppréssed.
    It is hé who gives bréad to the húngry, *
    - the Lórd, who sets prísoners frée,

    the Lórd who gives síght to the blínd, *
    - who ráises up thóse who are bówed down,

    - but thwárts the páth of the wícked.
    The Lórd will réign for éver, *
    - Sion’s Gód, from áge to áge.

<psalm>
    Blessed be the God and Father *
    - of our Lord Jesus Christ,
    who has blessed us in Christ *
    - with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places.

    He chose us in him *
    - before the foundation of the world,
    that we should be holy *
    - and blameless before him.

    He destined us in love *
    - to be his sons through Jesus Christ,
    according to the purpose of his will, †
    - to the praise of his glorious grace *
    - which he freely bestowed on us in the Beloved.

    In him we have redemption through his blood, *
    - the forgiveness of our trespasses,
    according to the riches of his grace *
    - which he lavished upon us.

    He has made known to us †
    - in all wisdom and insight *
    - the mystery of his will,
    according to his purpose *
    - which he set forth in Christ.

    His purpose he set forth in Christ, *
    - as a plan for the fullness of time,
    to unite all things in him, *
    - things in heaven and things on earth.

<p>
    But because of Christ, I have come to consider all these advantages that I had as disadvantages.
    Not only that, but I believe nothing can happen that will outweigh the supreme advantage of knowing
    Christ Jesus my Lord. For him I have accepted the loss of everything, and I look on everything
    as so much rubbish if only I can have Christ.

    My soul glórifies the Lórd, *

    Confiding in Christ, the God-Man, we ask to serve him in holiness and justice. Let us call upon him saying: <br />  <sp>R/</sp> <em>You are the Holy One, Lord.</em>
    You, who wanted to undergo temptation to be as we are, yet without sinning;
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span> have mercy on us, Lord Jesus.&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>
    You, who called us to perfect charity in the order of Saint Paul the First Hermit;
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span> sanctify us, Lord Jesus.&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>
    You, who wanted us to become the salt of the earth and the light of the word under the protection of Mary, Our Mother;
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span> enlighten us, Lord Jesus.&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>
    You came to serve, not to be served;
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span> let us humbly serve you and our brothers, your people.&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>
    You, who reflected the glory of God and bear the very stamp of his nature;
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span> grant us that, living as a community, each one of us may give glory to God and draw young people to the service of your Mother.&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>
    You, who abolished death through your death, and brought us to life and immortality;
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span> give eternal peace and rest to our deceased brothers and benefactors.&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>

<litany>God, you granted that Saint Paul, our Father,
    achieve sanctity in the desert,
    grant through his intercession,
    that we, who are striving to develop
    in ourselves a spirit of prayer and service,
    may come ever closer to you in love.
    Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
    who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
    one God, for ever and ever.
