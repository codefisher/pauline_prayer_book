<h2><span class="rubric">Solemnity</span></h2>

<p><em>
    Paul was born around 228 AD in Thebes. When he was 16, the persecutions of Christians began. Hiding in the desert, he resolved to spend the rest of his life in solitude and in prayer.

<h2>Evening Prayer I</h2>

<reading label="Hymn"></reading>

<psalm>
    Paul, who off in distant lands,
    The crowd and clamour avoided,
    Dared to live in woods and forests,
    Dwelling in an obscure cavern.

    Lone out there you fought and won
    O’er the monstrous creatures of hell,
    Teaching us to gain the relish
    All the joys of peace of soul.

    Winner of heavenly city,
    Disregard not the prayers
    Of those who devoutly sing to you
    With hymns of praise.

    May our lives be free from sin,
    Virtue and piety dwelling there.
    May our hearts forever reflect
    Divine peace, light and glory

    Glory be to the Father,
    Glory to the only begotten
    Glory to the loving Spirit
    May we join with Paul God’s glory
</psalm>

    <span class="rubric">Ant. 1:</span> Do not be worry about your life, what you shall eat and drink. Your heavenly Father knows what you need them all.

<p class="ref">Psalm 112 (113)</p>
<psalm>
    Praise, O servants of the Lord, *
    - praise the name of the Lord!
    May the name of the Lord be blessed *
    - both now and for evermore!
    From the rising of the sun to its setting *
    - praise be the name of the Lord!

    High above all the nations is the Lord, *
    - above the heavens his glory.
    Who is like the Lord, our God, *
    - who has rise on high to his throne
    Yet stoops from the heights to look down, *
    - to look down upon heaven and earth.

    From the dust he lifts up the lowly, *
    - from his misery he raises the poor
    To set him in the company of princes, *
    - yes, with the princes of his people.
    To the Childless wife he gives a home *
    - and gladdens her heart with children.

<p class="ref">Psalm 145 (146)</p>
<psalm>
    My soul, give praise to the Lord; †
    - I will praise the Lord all my days, *
    - make music to my God while I live.

    Put no trust in princes, *
    - in mortal men in whom there is no help.
    Take their breath, they return to clay *
    - and their plans that day come to nothing.

    He is happy who is helped by Jacob’s God, *
    - whose hope is in the Lord his God,
    who alone made heaven and earth, *
    - the seas and all they contain.

    It is he who keeps faith forever, *
    - who is just to those who are oppressed.
    It is he who gives bread to the hungry, *
    - the Lord, who sets prisoners free,

    the Lord who gives sight to the blind, *
    - who raises up those who are bowed down,
    the Lord, who protects the stranger *
    - and upholds the widow and orphan.

    It is the Lord who loves the just *
    - but thwarts the path of the wicked.
    The Lord will reign forever *
    - Sion’s God, from age to age.

<psalm>
    Blessed be the God and Father *
    - of our Lord Jesus Christ,
    who has blessed us in Christ *
    - with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places.

    He chose us in him *
    - before the foundation of the world,
    that we should be holy *
    - and blameless before him.

    He destined us in love *
    - to be his sons through Jesus Christ,
    according to the purposes of his will, †
    - to the praise of his glorious grace *
    - which he freely bestowed on us in the beloved.

    In him we have redemption through his blood, *
    - the forgiveness of our trespasses,
    according to the riches of his grace *
    - which he lavished upon us.

    He has made known to us †
    - in all wisdom and insight *
    - the mystery of his will,
    according to his purpose *
    - which he set forth in Christ.

    His purpose he set forth in Christ,*
    - as a plan for the fullness of time
    to unite all things in him *
    - things in heaven and things on earth.

<p>
    But because of Christ, I have come to consider all these advantages that I had as disadvantages.
    Not only that, but I believe nothing can happen that will outweigh the supreme advantage of knowing
    Christ Jesus my Lord. For him I have accepted the loss of everything, and I look on everything
    as so much rubbish if only I can have Christ.

<psalm>
    My soul glorifies the Lord, *
    - my spirit rejoices in God, my Saviour.
    He looks on his servant in her lowliness; *
    - henceforth all ages will call me blessed.

    The Almighty works marvels for me. *
    - Holy his name!
    His mercy is from age to age, *
    - on those who fear him.


    He puts forth his arm in strength *
    - and scatters the proud hearted.
    He casts the mighty from their thrones *
    - and raises the lowly.

    He fills the starving with good things, *
    - send the rich away empty.

    He protects Israel, his servant, *
    - remembering his mercy,
    the mercy promised to our fathers, *
    - to Abraham and his sons forever.

    Confiding in Christ, the God-Man, we ask to serve him in holiness and justice. Let us call upon him saying: <br />  <sp>R/</sp> <em>You are the Holy One, Lord.</em>
    You, who wanted to undergo temptation to be as we are, yet without sinning,
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span> have mercy on us, Lord Jesus. <sp>R/</sp>
    You, who called us to perfect charity in the order of St Paul the First Hermit,
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span> sanctify us, Lord Jesus. <sp>R/</sp>
    You, who wanted us to become the salt of the earth and the light of the word under the protection of Mary, Our Mother,
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span> enlighten us, Lord Jesus. <sp>R/</sp>
    You, who reflected the glory of God and bear the very stamp of his nature,
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span> grant us that, living as a community, each one of us may give glory to God and draw young people to the service of your Mother. <sp>R/</sp>
