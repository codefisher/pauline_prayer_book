<h2>Office of Readings</h2>

<psalm>
    Eusebius, man according to God's Heart,
    Clothed with many holy virtues,
    Like a graceful lily flower
    Which adorns the hermitage.

    God anointed you His Priest,
    Pouring love into your chaste heart,
    Sent to nourish faithful people
    With Christ's precious Blood and Body.

    As the loyal Master's servant
    You exulted the Cross so high,
    Never doubting the Lord's closeness
    In the midst of dreadful horrors.

    A sword of Love has pierced your heart,
    So your've chosen wild woods,
    By your prayers and sacrifices,
    To become Paul's faithful son.

    A new and marvelous Pentecost:
    As the Spirit gathers faithful brothers,
    Making the the rays of sun
    To Disperse all evil darkness.

    May your deeds, oh Holy Founder,
    Awaken anew in hearts and souls,
    Contemplation and true service,
    Lest we ever lose our calling.

    Let's all hearts grateful to the Almighty,
    Be praising the Father and the Son,
    May the Spirit always keep us
    In the Blessed Virgin's school.
    Amen.

<reading label="First Reading" ref="4:24, 29, 31-39"
         tagline="You heard his words from the middle of the fire">A
    reading from the book of Deuteronomy
</reading>
<p>
    For the Lord your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God.
</p>

<p>
    If, however, from there you start searching once more for the Lord your God, and if you search
    for him honestly and sincerely, you will find him. For the Lord your God is a merciful God and
    will not desert or destroy you or forget the covenant which he made on oath with your ancestors.
</p>

<p>
    &lsquo;Put this question, then, to the ages that are past, that have gone before you, from when God
    created the human race on earth: Was there ever a word so majestic, from one end of heaven to
    the other? Was anything like it ever heard? Did ever a people hear the voice of the living God
    speaking from the heart of the fire, as you have heard it, and remain alive? Has it ever been
    known before that any god took action himself to bring one nation out of another one, by
    ordeals, signs, wonders, war with mighty hand and outstretched arm, by fearsome terrors&mdash;all
    of which things the Lord your God has done for you before your eyes in Egypt?
</p>

<p>
    &lsquo;This he showed you, so that you might know that the Lord is the true God and that there is no
    other. To instruct you, he made you hear his voice from heaven, and on earth he let you see his
    great fire, and from the heart of the fire you heard his words. Because he loved your ancestors
    and, after them, chose their descendants, he has brought you out of Egypt, displaying his
    presence and mighty power; dispossessing for you nations who were larger and stronger than you,
    to make way for you and to give you their country as your heritage, as it still is today.
</p>

<p>
    &lsquo;Hence, grasp this today and meditate on it carefully: the Lord is the true God, in heaven above
    as on earth beneath, he and no other.&rsquo;

    reading from Fr Gregory Gyöngyösi's the lives of the Brothers of the Order of St. Paul the First
    Hermit.
</reading>

<p>
    Eusebius was born in the Hungarian city of Esztergom from parents who enjoyed excellent and
    widespread esteem. In his years of youth, truth attracted him. His ability to endure hunger and
    thirst grew so much that everyone admired that a man, with such a delicate and subtle constitution, but
    satisfied with such scarce food, could lead such a life, always being joyful. He kept great
    vigils and spent his time reciting the Divine Office or in contemplation or in study. He learned
    philosophy, thanks to which mortals may become pleasing to God. Thus, he wrote books,
    without neglecting the perfect fulfillment of God's commandments, taking care of the Lord's words
    “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who practices
    and teaches them, such a man will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.” (cf. Mt 7:21 and Mt 5:19)
    When, due to his acknowledged merits, he was granted the dignity of a Canon of Esztergom,
    among many other glorious deeds he wished to practice hospitality, just as the patriarch Abraham
    once did. For this reason, he often visited the brothers living alone in the forests. They, in
    turn, came from the hermitage to his home to exchange wicker baskets for bread. Meeting them
    gave him so much joy, that he frequently went there where God’s servants went out of duty, like
    an industrious worker bee following sweet honey. Thus, he decided to leave this world, his
    homeland, material things and his relatives, to serve with all humility the Lord of hosts.
    Blessed be the man, Eusebius, filled in a marvelous way with God's love. Not wanting to hide
    the bonds of charity that enveloped him, he offered his friends and acquaintances the flowers of
    virtue and a burning spirit of devotion — forgetting his past riches and considering all things
    passing as dung — his friends decided to go and live with him to win Christ alone. In this way,
    he made those that had tasted the sweetness of God's love, disposed to desire to follow the
    Lord stripped on the Cross, immediately and without any remains, just as soon as the wars ended
    with the enemy heathen Tatars. Eusebius, therefore, with his companions, postponed leaving
    Esztergom until peace was restored. However, later, with the same devotion, though not with the
    same age, they went to the inhabitants of the hermitage, declaring that with them they would
    sincerely serve the Lord Jesus Christ. They did so even though relatives and friends tried to
    dissuade them from doing so. Eusebius, much more firm than others, refuted the temptations,
    usually responding, “Listen, — he said — after all, Christ chose the torment, although He loved
    His mother and He knew that His suffering would cause her suffering, because her soul would be
    pierced by the sword of sorrows. He did not spare also the close and beloved John the
    Evangelist, burdened beyond all imagining with the fear of sorrows, because although he could
    come down from the cross, He did not do it, but remained there until His death. In the same way,
    because of you who suffer and for us who weep, we do not want to leave the cross of repentance,
    but we will remain steadfast until death. Let the disgraceful confusion not tear us away from
    the world that is better.” Hearing this, flooding with tears, crushed in heart and touched by
    remorse, they could not answer the spirit that spoke through him. Surely, the hermit's brothers,
    though seasoned in the holy life, benefited greatly from him.
</p>
<p>
    Brother Eusebius, a man devoted to God, a magnificent lover of the desert, living with six
    brothers in a cave consisting of three rooms, laid the foundations of the future monastery
    following the monastic rule. He himself once lived in the cave, near a fountain, which flows in
    honour of the Holy Cross. That same Cross whose power made powerless all the attempts of the
    ancient enemy of the human race. He himself lived rich in virtue, distinguished by piety and
    sanctity, though with a weak and pale body. He was seasoned in all humility, taking away from
    his mouth and lessening, curtailing to a minimum the measure of food and drink by which he was
    always healthy and beautiful. Enlightened by God's grace, among the various pious duties and
    works, he very earnestly practiced hospitality. The renown caused by him, which made him
    famous, brought to him a young man named Benedict, who dedicated himself to the service of monks
    forever, sharing with them the same kind of holy life in the community. Another, who was named
    Stefan, destined to become a general of hermits in the future, also joined by his example. At
    that time, the pious father, rejoicing at every penitent, went to the oratory, where, as he used
    to, thanking God in an ardent and highly repentant spirit, full of tears, begging the Lord, the
    Giver of all things, to multiply the number of novices and preserve them in their sacred
    commitment.
</p>
<p>
    Undoubtedly, thanks to his merits and prayers, they remained steadfast. In addition, many others
    old and young arrived. Then, kings and princes, and noblemen of different kingdoms, erected
    numerous monasteries whose names were written around 1263.
</p>
<p>
    In 1262, the aforementioned Eusebius, the provincial prior, having taken several brothers with
    him, came to Urban IV and asked for the Blessed Augustine's Rule. St. Thomas Aquinas usefully
    came to help in the Roman Curia.
</p>
<p>
    Eusebius, a most prosperous and a most sincere father, who always lived in the greatest
    submission to the Lord God and very zealously serving his fellow men, established numerous
    coenobia in Hungary. When he was about to go to eternal rest near the moment of his death, in
    order to shape their religious and saintly life, he gave a beautiful encouragement to all his
    numerous disciples&mdash;that they would love God above all else, and then our neighbour, because
    these are the two main commandments given to us. Moreover, that among other virtues they keep
    obedience, for the kingdom of heaven is gained only by those obedient to the commandments. He
    then added that they ought to keep his salutary instructions as a mark of unity. In the presence
    of the brothers, while they were praying, in beautiful old age, he fell asleep with his fathers
    and was buried at the Holy Cross on February 20.
