<h1 class="index" id="night">Night Prayer II</h1>

<reading label="Hymn"></reading>

<psalm>
    Abide with me; fast flows the eventide;
    The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide;
    When other helpers fail, and comforts flee,
    Help of the helpless, O abide with me.

    Swift to its close ebbs out life’s little day:
    Earth’s joys grow dim, its glories pass away;
    Change and decay in all around I see;
    O thou who changes not, abide with me.

    Hold thou thy Cross before my closing eyes;
    Shine through the gloom, and point me to the skies;
    Heaven’s morning breaks, and earth’s vain shadows flee;
    In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.
</psalm>

<reading shorttag="In the shelter of the Most High" ref="Psalm 90 (91)"></reading>

<psalm>
    He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High *
    - and abides in the shade of the Almighty
    says to the Lord: ‘My refuge, *
    - my stronghold, my God in whom I trust!’

    It is he who will free you from the snare *
    - of the fowler who seeks to destroy you;
    he will conceal you with his pinions *
    - and under his wings you will find refuge.

    You will not fear the terror of the night *
    - nor the arrow that flies by day,
    nor the plague that prowls in the darkness *
    - nor the scourge that lays waste at noon.

    A thousand may fall at your side, *
    - ten thousand fall at your right,
    you, it will never approach; *
    - his faithfulness is buckler and shield.

    Your eyes have only to look *
    - to see how the wicked are repaid,
    you who have said: ‘Lord, my refuge!’ *
    - and have made the Most High your dwelling.

    Upon you no evil shall fall, *
    - no plague approach where you dwell.
    For you has he commanded his angels, *
    - to keep you in all your ways.

    They shall bear you upon their hands *
    - lest you strike your foot against a stone.
    On the lion and the viper you will tread *
    - and trample the young lion and the dragon.

    Since he clings to me in love, I will free him; *
    - protect him for he knows my name.
    When he calls I shall answer: ‘I am with you,’ *
    - I will save him in distress and give him glory.

    With length of life I will content him; *
    - I shall let him see my saving power.

    At last, all-powerful Master, +
    - you give leave to your servant *
    - to go in peace, according to your promise.

    the light to enlighten the Gentiles
    - and give glory to Israel, your people.

Ave Regina caelorum!

Et pro nobis Christum exora
