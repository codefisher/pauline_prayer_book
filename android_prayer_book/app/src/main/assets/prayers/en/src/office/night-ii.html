<h1 class="index" id="night">Night Prayer II</h1>

<reading label="Hymn"></reading>

<psalm>
    Abide with me: fast falls the eventide;
    the darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide;
    when other helpers fail and comforts flee,
    help of the helpless, O abide with me.

    Swift to its close ebbs out life’s little day;
    earth’s joys grow dim, its glories pass away;
    change and decay in all around I see:
    O thou who changest not, abide with me.

    Hold thou thy cross before my closing eyes;
    shine through the gloom, and point me to the skies;
    heaven’s morning breaks, and earth’s vain shadows flee;
    in life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.
</psalm>

<reading shorttag="In the shelter of the Most High" ref="Psalm 90 (91)"></reading>

<psalm>
    He who dwélls in the shélter of the Most Hígh *
    - and abídes in the sháde of the Almíghty
    sáys to the Lórd: ‘My réfuge, *
    - my strónghold, my Gód in whom I trúst!’

    It is hé who will frée you from the snáre *
    - of the fówler who séeks to destróy you;
    hé will concéal you with his pínions *
    - and únder his wíngs you will find réfuge.

    You will not féar the térror of the níght *
    - nor the árrow that flíes by dáy,
    nor the plágue that prówls in the dárkness *
    - nor the scóurge that lays wáste at nóon.

    A thóusand may fáll at your síde, *
    - tén thousand fáll at your ríght,
    yóu, it will néver appróach; *
    - his fáithfulness is búckler and shíeld.

    Your éyes have ónly to lóok *
    - to sée how the wícked are repáid,
    yóu who have said: ‘Lórd, my réfuge!’ *
    - and have máde the Most Hígh your dwélling.

    Upon yóu no évil shall fáll, *
    - no plágue appróach where you dwéll.
    For yóu has he commánded his ángels, *
    - to kéep you in áll your wáys.

    They shall béar you upón their hánds *
    - lest you stríke your fóot against a stóne.
    On the líon and the víper you will tréad *
    - and trámple the young líon and the drágon.

    Since he clíngs to me in lóve, I will frée him; *
    - protéct him for he knóws my náme.
    When he cálls I shall ánswer: ‘I am wíth you,’ *
    - I will sáve him in distréss and give him glóry.

    With léngth of lífe I will contént him; *
    - I shall lét him see my sáving pówer.

Ave Regina caelorum!
