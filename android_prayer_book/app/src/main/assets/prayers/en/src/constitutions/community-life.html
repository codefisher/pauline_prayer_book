<h1 class="index">Chapter IV: Community Life</h1>


<h2 id="art37">Article 37</h2>

<p>
    The <span index="Pauline Community">Pauline Community</span> has its origins in the <span index="God's Will">will of our Heavenly Father</span> who gathers us together
    as one. It is further created by virtue of the authority of the Church as well as by the active
    and personal striving of all our Brethren to imitate <span index="Christ">Christ</span> who assures those gathered in His
    name of His presence. It is in this way that the members bring about perfect unity of life in a
    spirit of truth and charity reflecting the <span index="Trinity">Holy Trinity</span> itself. This fraternal union constitutes
    for others a witness of the coming and presence of Christ and becomes for us a source of great
    apostolic strength.
</p>


<h2 id="art38">Article 38</h2>

<p>
    Our Community is brought into being and is strengthened through the <span index="Evangelical Counsels">Evangelical Counsels</span>.
    <span index="Chastity">Chastity</span> opens our hearts mutually one to the other <span index="Poverty">Poverty</span> enriches through the input of
    personal talents and efforts. Through <span index="Obedience">Obedience</span>, we are lead to the knowledge of the <span index="God's Will">Will of
    God</span>. Our organized life of <span index="Prayer">prayer</span>, our intent listening to the <span index="Sacred Scripture">Word of God</span> and <span index="Meditation">meditating</span> upon
    it as well as our sharing in the <span index="Eucharist">Eucharist</span> becomes the Community’s meeting with God.
</p>


<h2 id="art39">Article 39</h2>

<p>
    <span index="Priesthood">Priests</span>, <span index="Seminarians">seminarians</span> and <span index="Brothers">brothers</span> constitute a tightly knit brotherhood and are united into a
    true family in Christ becoming thereby, a source of mutual support in the living out their
    vocation. (Can. 602).
</p>
<p>
    Bound with the life, the works and the responsibility for it, they enjoy the same rights and
    responsibilities, with the exception of those that flow from <span index="Priesthood">Holy Orders</span> or responsibilities
    entrusted to them. All members are obliged to work for unity of mind and heart through their
    common unity in God, through prayer, by complying with the discipline of the Order, by
    maintaining vigilance over themselves in the light of the <span index="Gospel">Gospel</span>, as well as through the sharing
    of all goods in common, by common fulfilment of obligations as well as through the organised
    meetings, recreation and other expressions of <span index="Community Life">Community Life</span>.
</p>


<h2 id="art40">Article 40</h2>


<ol>
    <li> The <span index="Superior">Superior</span> plays a special role in creating a united community. He is principally
        responsible for the Community, its life and fruitful activity. Through his ability to rule
        using sound advice and life experience through constant concern, dedication and prayer, he
        unites the Community according to the spirit of the <span index="Gospel">Gospels</span> and the <span index="Constitutions">Constitutions</span>.
    </li>

    <li> The members of the Community should cooperate with the Superior in executing his mandates.
        They should embrace him with trust, respect, charity, and active cooperation.
    </li>


</ol>

<h2 id="art41">Article 41</h2>

<p>
    Each <span index="Monk">Monk</span> is obliged to help create within the <span index="Cloister">cloister</span>, an atmosphere of charity, trust,
    respect, mutual esteem and forbearance. It is this type of <span index="Fraternal Charity">fraternal charity</span>, which guards
    against distrust, suspicion, violation of prudence, harbouring of injuries as well as kinds of
    divisions, or the favouring of certain person with privileges.
</p>
<p>
    We strive to enrich one another through our individual strengths, seeking to be at one another’s
    service. We strive to deepen our appreciation for our vocation and take upon ourselves new
    obligations and initiatives. It is thanks to such an attitude that all of us feel embraced by
    the love of <span index="Christ">Christ</span> in the home of our <span index="Mary">Mother</span>.
</p>

<h2 id="art42">Article 42</h2>

<p>
    Our Monks are obliged to live in a house of the Order and to lead a common life (cf: 665, §.1).
</p>
<p>
    In our concern for fraternal charity and peace within the monastery, let cloister be observed
    strictly and prudently in our houses. It should serve to create solitude with God. The
    obligation of cloister not only obliges us not to bring in outsiders, but also prevents us
    leaving thee houses of the Order without the permission of the superior. Mutual charity and good
    manners demand quietness and tranquillity, so necessary to any work and prayer, to be kept
    within the confines of cloister.
</p>

<h2 id="art43">Article 43</h2>

<p>
    We should receive the guests who visit our houses in spirit of kindness and charity remembering
    the word of Christ: “I was a stranger and you took me in” (Mt. 25:35). While the whole Community
    should be concerned about this, it should be above all the concern of the Superior or his
    substitute. Guests coming to our houses from other Pauline Communities are to observe the good
    order of the Monastery in which they are staying. Our Monks should extend sincere kindness to
    all but especially to those persons who are closest to us.
</p>


<h2 id="art44">Article 44</h2>

<p>
    All <span index="Monk">Monks</span> and especially <span index="Superior">Superiors</span> should manifest great concern and love for the sick members
    of Community. They should be provided with everything with charity, prudence that local
    conditions permit. Mindful of Our Lord’s words“ I was sick and you visited me,” ( Mt. 25:36),
    let them spare no efforts in regard to the <span index="Sickness">sick</span>, expending energy and time in caring for them,
    in visiting them, and if need be, even remaining with them. Care must be taken to provide
    professional services for those seriously ill.
</p>

<h2 id="art45">Article 45</h2>

<p>
    <span index="Fraternal Charity">Fraternal charity</span> rises above everything, which could differentiate or divide. Special attention
    must be paid to the young, the suffering, and those who are broken in spirit. We should manifest
    sincere respect toward those Brothers afflicted with any disability as regards work or old age,
    and who now find themselves patiently bearing the <span index="Cross">Cross</span> having used their energies for the good
    of the Order. We should be mindful that they likewise serve the <span index="Kingdom of God">Kingdom of God</span>. They have a
    right to expect understanding, kindness and care. Such members may, if they so desire, be
    dispensed from all <span index="Community Life">Community exercises and obligations</span>. Let them; on the other hand, make every
    effort to encourage the Community in faithfulness to our call by cheerfully enduring their old
    age.
</p>


<h2 id="art46">Article 46</h2>

<p>
    It is our responsibility to provide watchful and loving care to our confreres who are about to
    return their life to God. The bond of <span index="Fraternal Charity">fraternal charity</span> extends beyond the grave and within the
    Mystery of the Resurrection and the Communion of Saints, to be aware of our responsibility to
    remember our deceased in prayer. This we do embracing all our <span index="Departed">departed</span> brothers as well as
    members of their families, the <span index="Confraters">Confraters</span> of the Order, as well as the friends, <span index="Benefactors">benefactors</span> and
    those whom we served in the <span index="Apostolate">Apostolate</span>. The visible sign of remembrance of our departed Brothers
    is our taking part in their funeral and in the proper care of their <span index="Graves">graves</span>.
