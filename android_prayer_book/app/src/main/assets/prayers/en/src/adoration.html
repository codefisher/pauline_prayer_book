<h1 class="section">B. Life of Prayer and Sacrifice with Christ</h1>

<p class="instruction">
    The Second Vatican Council teaches that “the Eucharistic
    Sacrifice is the source and summit of the Christian life” (LG 11)
    and “&hellip; the other sacraments and indeed all ecclesiastical minis-
    tries and works of the apostolate are bound up with the Eucharist
    and are directed towards it” (<em>Presbyterorum Ordinis</em> 5). But for us, however, the
    Eucharist “becomes the power to live a life according to the Evan-
    gelical Counsels and is an effective help in bringing to reality the
    mission of our Monastic Community within the Church of
    God” (art. 20) and “to live the Mystery of the Cross” (art. 34).

<h2>1.2 Prayer of Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament</h2>

<div class="indent">
    <p>
        O Lord, Jesus Christ, in this adoration I wish to respond to
        your invitation: “Watch and pray.” Therefore, I desire to honour
        you, to confess my faith and love for you, truly present in this Most
        Holy Sacrament. You promised to remain with us to the end of
        time. I thank you for this promise and ask for forgiveness for my
        lack of love and weak faith. Strengthen and purify me by your
        Holy Spirit. Illumine the eyes of my mind, that I may honour you,
        not only with my lips, but with the holiness of my life.
    </p>
    <p>
        Jesus Christ, Son of the living God, you who are true God
        and true Man, I believe in your unique presence in the Most Holy
        Sacrament of the Eucharist and I thank you for so many blessings
        which you have showered upon me. I adore you for your Mother, whom
        you have given me as my Mother and Protectress. Following her
        example, I desire to live in union with you, my supreme God.
    </p>
    <p>
        I salute you, O most merciful heart of my Lord, Jesus! I
        desire to make reparation for all the outrages committed by your
        enemies against your divine presence in this Sacrament. Through
        this act of humility and adoration, I wish to adore you in all places
        on earth, where you are neglected and less reverenced.
    </p>
    <p>
        O Jesus, I love you with all my heart. I am sorry that in
        the past I have saddened you, my infinite Goodness. I resolve with
        the help of your grace not to offend you anymore and now, as poor
        as I am, I consecrate myself totally to you. I renounce my will, my
        senses, my desires and everything I possess. From this moment on,
        direct me according to your liking. I long only for your divine
        love, and I pray for the grace of perseverance in this love to the end
        and to fulfil perfectly your Holy Will. I commend to you the poor
        souls in Purgatory, particularly those who had a special devotion to
        the Most Holy Sacrament and to the Most Blessed Virgin Mary. I
        commend to you, also, the unfortunate sinners.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, my Beloved Saviour, I join all my intentions with
        those of your Sacred Heart and thus joined, I offer them to your
        Eternal Father and I ask Him in your Holy Name to accept and gra-
        ciously answer them. Amen.
    </p>
