<h2><span class="rubric">Solemnity</span></h2>

<p><em>
    Paul was born around AD 228 in Thebes. When he was sixteen, the persecutions of Christians began.
    Hiding in the desert, he resolved to spend the rest of his life in solitude and in prayer.

<litany>O that I had wings like a dove to fly away and be at rest.
    So I would escape far away and take refuge in the desert.
    I would hasten to find a shelter from the raging wind.</litany>

    God, you granted that Saint Paul, our Father,
    achieve sanctity in the desert,
    grant through his intercession,
    that we, who are striving to develop
    in ourselves a spirit of prayer and service,
    may come ever closer to you in love.
    Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
    who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
    one God, for ever and ever.

    <litany includeblank="includeblank" class="strong">
        It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,
        always and everywhere to give you thanks,
        Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God,
        through Christ our Lord.

        Fulfilling your eternal plan for our salvation,
        you willed that your chosen people pass through the desert
        where they made a covenant with you
        as a sign of the eternal covenant in the blood of your Son.

        In the fullness of time, he made that same desert holy
        when he was delivered by Joseph and Mary into Egypt.

        Then, when he was about to proclaim the Kingdom of Heaven,
        he was led by the Spirit into the desert
        to be tempted by the ancient adversary.
        At the same time he revealed
        that we are called through prayer and penance
        to conquer the glamour of evil
        and to adore and serve you alone.

        You also showed Saint Paul the proof provided by the desert:
        he possessed you alone.
        And so now he shines on our journey
        as the guide to evangelical perfection,
        So that we ourselves manifest in our mortal bodies
        the same paschal victory of your Son.

        Because of this gift of your goodness
        with the company of the Angels and the Saints
        we sing the hymn of your praise,
        as without end we acclaim:

        Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
        Heaven and earth are full of your glory.
        Hosanna in the highest.
        Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
        Hosanna in the highest.
    </litany>

<h2 class="rubric">Communion Antiphon <span class="ref">Ps 110(111):4-5</span></h2>

<litany>
    He makes us remember his wonders. The Lord is compassion and love.
    He gives food to those who fear him; keeps his covenant ever in mind.
</litany>

<h2 class="rubric">Prayer after Communion</h2>
<litany>Lord God, you willed to fortify Saint Paul
    with earthly food and guide him to yourself,
    we humbly beg you that, nourished by these holy Gifts
    we may be able to enjoy an eternal share in your glory.
    Through Christ our Lord.
</litany>
