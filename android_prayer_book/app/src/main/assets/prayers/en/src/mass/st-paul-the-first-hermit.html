<h2><span class="rubric">Solemnity</span></h2>

<p><em>
    Paul was born around 228 AD in Thebes. When he was 16, the persecutions of Christians began. Hiding in the desert, he resolved to spend the rest of his life in solitude and in prayer.

<litany includeblank="includeblank">
    It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,
    always and everywhere to give you thanks,
    Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God,
    through Christ our Lord.

    Fulfilling your eternal plan of salvation,
    you willed for your chosen people to pass through the desert
    where they might make a covenant with you
    as a token of the eternal covenant in the blood of your Son.

    Who in the fullness of time made the same desert holy
    when he was borne by Joseph and Mary into Egypt.

    Then, before proclaiming the Kingdom of Heaven
    he was led by the Spirit into the desert
    to be tempted by the ancient adversary,
    at the same time revealing through prayer and penance
    that we are called to conquer the glamour of evil
    to adore and serve you alone.

    You also showed the trial of the desert to Saint Paul
    that he might possess you alone.
    And so now he shines on our journey
    as the guide to the perfection of the Gospel,
    whence we ourselves may bear in our mortal bodies
    the same paschal victory of your Son.

    Because of this gift of your goodness
    with the company of the Angels and the Saints
    we sing the hymn of your praise,
    as without end we acclaim:

    Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
    Heaven and earth are full of your glory.
    Hosanna in the highest.
    Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
    Hosanna in the highest.
</litany>

<h2 class="rubric">Communion Antiphon  <span class="ref">Ps 111:4-5</span></h2>

<litany>
    He makes us remember his wonders. The Lord is compassion and love.
    He gives food to those who fear him; keeps his covenant ever in mind.
</litany>

<h2 class="rubric">Prayer after Communion</h2>
<litany>Lord God, you were willing to fortify Saint Paul
    with earthly food and guide him to yourself,
    we humbly beg you that nourished by these Holy Gifts
    we will achieve a share in your eternal glory.
    Through Christ our Lord.
</litany>
