<h2>Morning Prayer</h2>

<reading label="Hymn"></reading>

<psalm>
    Remember those, O Lord,
    Who in your peace have died,
    Yet may not gain love's high reward
    Till love is purified!

    With you they faced death's night,
    Sealed with your victory sign,
    Soon may the splendour of your light
    On them for ever shine!

    Sweet is their pain, yet deep,
    Till perfect love is born;
    Their lone night-watch they gladly keep
    Before your radiant morn!

    Your love is their great joy;
    Your will their one desire;
    As finest gold without alloy
    Refine them in love's fire!

    For them we humbly pray;
    Perfect them in your love!
    O may we share eternal day
    With them in heaven above.
</psalm>

<p class="ref">Psalm 89 (90)</p>
<psalm>
    O Lórd, you have béen our réfuge *
    - from óne generátion to the néxt.
    Befóre the móuntains were bórn †
    - or the éarth or the wórld brought fórth, *
    - you are Gód, without begínning or énd.

    You túrn men báck into dúst *
    - and say: ‘Go báck, sóns of mén.’
    To yóur eyes a thóusand yéars †
    - are like yésterday, cóme and góne, *
    - no móre than a wátch in the níght.

    You swéep men awáy like a dréam, *
    - like gráss which springs úp in the mórning.
    In the mórning it springs úp and flówers: *
    - by évening it wíthers and fádes.

    So wé are destróyed in your ánger, *
    - strúck with térror in your fúry.
    Our gúilt lies ópen befóre you; *
    - our sécrets in the líght of your fáce.

    All our dáys pass awáy in your ánger. *
    - Our lífe is óver like a sígh.
    Our spán is séventy yéars, *
    - or éighty for thóse who are stróng.

    And most of thése are émptiness and páin. *
    - They pass swíftly and wé are góne.
    Who understánds the pówer of your ánger *
    - and féars the stréngth of your fúry?

    Make us knów the shórtness of our lífe *
    - that we may gáin wísdom of héart.
    Lord, relént! Is your ánger for éver? *
    - Show píty tó your sérvants.

    In the mórning, fíll us with your lóve; *
    - we shall exúlt and rejóice all our dáys.
    Give us jóy to bálance our afflíction *
    - for the yéars when we knéw misfórtune.

    Show fórth your wórk to your sérvants; *
    - let your glóry shíne on their chíldren.
    Let the fávour of the Lórd be upón us: †
    - give succéss to the wórk of our hánds, *
    - give succéss to the wórk of our hánds.

</p>
<p class="ref">Canticle Isaiah 38:10-14, 17, 19b-20</p>
<psalm>
    I said, In the noontide of my days I must depart; †
    I am consigned to the gates of Sheol *
    for the rest of my years.

    I said, I shall not see the Lord *
    in the land of the living;
    I shall look upon man no more *
    among the inhabitants of the world.

    My dwelling is plucked up and removed from me *
    like a shepherd’s tent;
    like a weaver I have rolled up my life; *
    he cuts me off from the loom.

    From day to night you bring me to an end; *
    I cry for help until morning;
    like a lion he breaks all my bones; *
    from day to night you bring me to an end.

    Like a swallow or a crane I clamour, *
    I moan like a dove.
    My eyes are weary with looking upward. *
    O Lord, I am oppressed; be my security.

    Lo, it was for my welfare *
    that I had great bitterness;
    but you have held back my life *
    from the pit of destruction,
    for you have cast all my sins *
    behind your back.

    For Sheol cannot thank you, *
    death cannot praise you;
    those who go down to the pit *
    cannot hope for your faithfulness.

    The living, the living, he thanks you, †
    as I do this day; *
    the father makes known to the children your faithfulness.

    The Lord will save me, *
    and we will sing to stringed instruments
    all the days of our life, *
    at the house of the Lord.

<psalm>
    My sóul, give práise to the Lórd; †
    - I will práise the Lórd all my dáys, *
    - make músic to my Gód while I líve.

    Pút no trúst in prínces, *
    - In mortal mén in whóm there is no hélp.
    Take their bréath, they retúrn to cláy *
    - and their pláns that dáy come to nóthing.

    He is háppy who is hélped by Jacob’s Gód, *
    - whose hópe is in the Lórd his Gód,
    who alóne made héaven and éarth, *
    - the séas and áll they contáin.

    It is hé who keeps fáith for éver, *
    - who is júst to thóse who are oppréssed.
    It is hé who gives bréad to the húngry, *
    - the Lórd, who sets prísoners frée,

    the Lórd who gives síght to the blínd, *
    - who ráises up thóse who are bówed down,
    the Lórd, who protécts the stránger *
    - and uphólds the wídow and órphan.

    It is the Lórd who lóves the júst *
    - but thwárts the páth of the wícked.
    The Lórd will réign for éver, *

    God, the Father almighty, raised Jesus from the dead and he will give life to our own mortal bodies. We pray to him in faith: <br />  <sp>R/</sp> <em>Lord, bring us to life in Christ.</em>
    Holy Father, we have been buried with your Son in baptism to rise with him in glory;
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span> may we always live in Christ and not see death for ever.&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>
    Father, you have given us the living bread from heaven to be eaten with faith and love;
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span> grant that we may have eternal life and be raised up on the last day.&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>
    Lord, when your Son was in agony you sent an angel to console him;
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span> at the hour of our death take away all fear and fill our hearts with hope.&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>
    You delivered the three young men from the blazing furnace;
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span> free the souls of the dead from the punishments their sins have deserved.&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>
    God of the living and the dead, you brought Jesus back to life;
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span> raise up the faithful departed, and let us come with them into your heavenly glory.&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>

    O God, glory of the faithful and life of the just,
    by the Death and Resurrection of whose Son
    we have been redeemed,
    look mercifully on your departed servants,
    the brothers, relatives and benefactors of our Order,
    that, just as they professed the mystery of our resurrection,
    so they may merit to receive the joys of eternal happiness.
    Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
    who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
    one God, for ever and ever.
