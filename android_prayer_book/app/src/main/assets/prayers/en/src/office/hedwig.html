<h2><span class="rubric">Optional Memorial</span></h2>

<p><em>
    Hedwig, born the year 1374, was the daughter of King Louis, the King of Hungary and Poland. From
    her father, she inherited the Polish Throne and was crowned in 1384. Marrying the Grand Duke of
    Lithuania, Władysław Jagieło, she contributed to the conversion of Lithuania to Christianity.
    She supported the creation of the Krakow Theological institute as well as the renewal of the
    university. Throughout her whole life, she was marked by generosity to the poor. She died in
    Krakow on the 17th of July 1399.

<p>
    Elizabeth, Queen of Hungary, the Widow of Ludwig, finally fulfilled her repeated promise to send
    Hedwig, her daughter, to Poland, especially when she saw that it was already a dangerous thing
    for the Poles to prolong their hopes for her arrival. She sent her with a large retinue of lords
    and knights, among which were Cardinal Dimitri the presbyter of the Four Crowns and Archbishop
    of Esztergom and Jan, Bishop of the Khanate, with a magnificent royal expedition adorned with
    gold, silver, vessels and costly robes, jewels, purples and silks.
</p>
<p>
    Upon the news of her arrival, the prelates and Polish Lords, who had already doubted if her
    arrival was to come at all, hurried to meet her and led her with great joy in a ceremonial
    procession of the clergy and all states of life to Krakow. Such was the favour of the prelates
    and Lords of Poland towards her, that with such great and affectionate love, forgetting almost
    their masculine seriousness, did not feel any disgrace in subjection to such a noble and
    virtuous woman.
</p>
<p>
    In fact, this motivated their love and favour; that they did not appoint her a spouse, thinking
    that she herself was enough to rule the kingdom with no need for a husband. Therefore, thus, on
    the fifteenth day of October, on which the Poles celebrate the feast of St. Hedwig, in the
    Cathedral of Krakow, Bodzenta, the archbishop of Gniezno, the Bishop John of Krakow, Jan of the
    See of Włocławek and Dobrogost of Poznan, crowned her. They did so in the presence of the
    aforementioned Cardinal Archbishop of Esztergom, and a large gathering of Lords and knights of
    both the Polish and Hungarian kingdoms. They anointed her as the Queen of the Poles, having
    given her total authority to manage the kingdom. That is until she would given a spouse capable
    of ruling.
</p>
<p>
    And no wonder: for they knew that she was well brought up and educated, that in her virtues,
    beauty, charming modesty, splendour of the heart, purity of her renown virginity, and the
    gentleness and sweetness of her morals, greatly outnumber even that of the noblest families.
    They saw in her a rare allure, which naturally adorned her. Learned in the sciences, whilst
    retaining her stateliness she comported herself as a lady, but above all she was temperate and
    modest. Heaven itself endowed Hedwig with these gifts so much so, that never had the world seen
    such a woman, but above all the aforementioned modesty dwelled in her, which is the best
    ornament of a woman. It seemed as though she had drunk in all these virtues with her mother’s
    milk. Already as a young maiden, she seemed to bear the maturity and wisdom of a matron.
