    When the people are gathered, the Priest approaches the altar with the ministers while the Entrance Chant is sung.
</p>
<p class="rubric">
    When he has arrived at the altar, after making a profound bow with the ministers, the Priest venerates the altar with a kiss and, if appropriate, incenses the cross and the altar. Then, with the ministers, he goes to the chair.
</p>
<p class="rubric">
    When the Entrance Chant is concluded, the Priest and the faithful, standing, sign themselves with the Sign of the Cross, while the Priest, facing the people, says:
</p>

<player>mass/sign-of-cross</player>

<litany class="strong">
    In the name of the Father, and of the Son,
        - and of the Holy Spirit.

    Then the Priest, extending his hands, greets the people, saying:
</p>

<litany class="strong">
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,

and the communion of the Holy Spirit
be with you all.

<p class="rubric" number="4.">
    Then follows the Penitential Act, to which the Priest invites the faithful, saying:

    A brief pause for silence follows. Then all recite together the formula of general confession:
</p>

<litany class="strong">
I confess to almighty God
and to you, my brothers and sisters,
that I have greatly sinned,
in my thoughts and in my words,
in what I have done and in what I have failed to do,
</litany>

<p class="rubric">
    And, striking their breast, they say:
</p>

<litany class="strong">
through my fault, through my fault,
through my most grievous fault;
</litany>

<p class="rubric">
    Then they continue:
</p>

<litany class="strong">
therefore I ask blessed Mary ever-Virgin, all the Angels and Saints,
and you, my brothers and sisters,
to pray for me to the Lord our God.

<p class="rubric">
The absolution by the Priest follows:
