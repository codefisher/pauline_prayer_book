<p><em>
    The scriptures tells us that God, in His Providence sends Angels to protect His people and to
    guide them to their determined goal. The Church invites us to render thanks for the
    presence of the Angels among us and to turn to them for protection in the dangers of life and
    temptation.

        It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,
        always and everywhere to give you thanks,
        Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God,
        and to praise you without end
        in your Archangels and Angels.

        For the honour we pay the angelic creatures
        in whom you delight
        redounds to your own surpassing glory,
        and by their great dignity and splendour
        you show how infinitely great you are,
        to be exalted above all things,
        Through Christ our Lord.

        Through him the multitude of Angels extols your majesty,
        and we are united with them in exultant adoration,
        as with one voice of praise we acclaim:

        Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
        Heaven and earth are full of your glory.
        Hosanna in the highest.
        Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
        Hosanna in the highest.
