<psalm red="57">
    This is the day whereon the Lord’s true witness,
    Whom all the nations lovingly do honour,
    Worthy at last was found to wear for ever
    -- Glory transcendent.

    Oft hands it been thro’ his sublime deserving
    Poor human bodies, howsoever stricken,
    Broke and cast off the bondage of their sickness
    -- Healed divinely.

    Healing and power, grace and beauteous honour
    Always be his, shining in the highest,
    Ruleth and keepeth all the world’s vast order,
    -- One God, three persons.
</psalm>

<psalm red="58">
    For all the saints who from their labours rest,
    Who thee by faith before the world confest,
    They name, O Jesu, be for ever blest.
    Alleluia! Alleluia!

    Thou wast their rock, their fortress and their might;
    Thou, Lord, their captain in the well-fought fight;
    Thou in the darkness drear their one true Light.
    Alleluia! Alleluia!

    O may thy soldiers, faithful, true and bold,
    Fight as the saints who nobly fought of old,
    And win, with them, the victor's crown of gold.
    Alleluia! Alleluia!

    O blest communion! fellowship divine!
    We fight as they did &rsquo;neath the holy sign;
    And all are one in thee, for all are thine.
    Alleluia! Alleluia!
</psalm>
