<h1 class="index"><span class="rubric">May 9</span> <br /> St Pachomius, Abbot</h1>

<h2><span class="rubric">Memorial</span></h2>

<p><em>
    Pachomius was an Egyptian Monk, the writer of the first rule of religious life and of
    coenobitism. He was born around 287AD in Egypt. In his youth he was recruited into the Roman
    Army. During his service, under the influence of the selfless help of Christians, he converted
    to the faith. He resolved to give himself to the exclusive service of God. He went into the
    Desert, where he lived in austere asceticism under the guidance of St Palemon, following which
    he lived a life of solitude in Tabenna, where he himself founded a monastic community.

<p>
    If anyone approaches the door of the monastery wanting to renounce the world and be included in
    the number of the brothers, he shall not be free to enter but shall be first be reported to the
    Father of the monastery, and he shall remain for a few days outside in front of the door. He
    shall be taught the Lord’s prayer and the Psalms, as many as he can learn thoroughly: and he
    shall diligently submit to a test in case he has perchance committed some wrongdoing and in a
    troubled state taken off fearfully on the spur of the moment, or is under some kind of control;
    he must show whether he can renounce his parents and despise his personal possessions.
</p>
<p>
    If they see that he is fit for prayer and everything else, then he shall be taught the remaining
    monastic discipline, which ones he must observe and carry out, whom he is obliged to obey,
    whether in the community of all the brothers or in the house to which he is to be assigned, or
    in the order of eating; so that, equipped and made perfect in every good work, he may be joined
    with the brothers. Then they shall strip him of his secular clothes and clothe him in the habit
    of the monks.
</p>
<p>
    We must remain firm and unmoving so that we may curb wandering thoughts, which boil over like
    water, by constantly meditating on God’s law, by which, tearing down the law of carnal
    concupiscence, we may be able to seek all that is pleasing to God and be kept safe from the
    world’s troubles and all pride, which is the worst kind of madness, worse than all other evils.
    Holding our Lord always before our eyes, let us recall the suffering of the crucifixion and
    death of him through whom we have been redeemed and brought to life. Let us therefore hate the
    world and everything in it; let us also hate every bodily comfort. Let us reject this life so
    that we may be able to live for God.
</p>
<p>
    Let us therefore, beloved, be mindful of our profession, how we promised to be devoted to God,
    for this is the very thing that will be asked of us on the day of judgment. Let us hunger,
    thirst, endure poverty, lack of sleep. Let us, immersed in our psalms and prayers, groan from
    the depths of our heart, pouring forth our tears. Let us test our true selves through careful
    examination in the hope that we may, even in some way, deserve to be found worthy of God in
    virtue of his boundless clemency. Let us not shrink from the distress of tribulation so that we
    may win rest in the consolation of our Lord and deserve to obtain the repose of an immortal and
    eternal life.

<litany>
    O Lord our God, grant to us, we beseech you,
    by the intercession of blessed Pachomius
    who purified himself in the desert for the sake of the monastical and cenobitical life
    and wrought a holy and bloodless martyrdom,
    that we may be acceptable to you in words and deeds
    and succeed in obtaining the inheritance of the kingdom of heaven.
    Through our Lord Jesus Christ your Son,
    who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
