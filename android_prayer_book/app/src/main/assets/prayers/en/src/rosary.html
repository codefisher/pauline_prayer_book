<h1>4. The Holy Rosary</h1>

<p class="instruction">
    Our religious Constitutions remind us that &ldquo;we honour
    Mary each day by reciting at least one portion of the Holy Rosary
    and praying the <a href="loreto.html">Litany of Loreto</a>&rdquo; (norm 66).
</p>

<p class="instruction">
    From among the fifteen mysteries of the Holy Rosary, only
    two are not mentioned in the Holy Scriptures. This is a reason why
    Pope Pius XII called the Rosary “a summary of the Gospel.” This
    is confirmed also by our Constitution: “Our devotion to the Most
    Holy Virgin is based on the Gospels and teaching of the
    Church” (art. 61)
