<h1 class="index">Chapter V: The Administration of the Goods of the Order</h1>


<h2 id="norm191">Norm 191</h2>

<p>
    Besides the general fund of the Order mentioned in the Constitutions and the general fund of the
    Province the General Chapter determines the payment to be made by individual provinces and
    monasteries to cover the current needs of the Order. The Provincial Chapter determines the
    payments to be rendered by individual monasteries to the Provincial fund.
</p>
<p>
    The Father General together with the deciding voice of his council can even outside the Chapter
    and for a sufficient reason determine the amount of the payment which should be made for the
    benefit of the Order by both provinces and individual monasteries.
</p>
<p>
    The Administrator-General is responsible for seeing that all Monies accruing from whatever title
    should be deposited into the common treasury. It is he who dispenses these same funds for the
    general needs of the Order under the direction of the Father General.
</p>


<h2 id="norm192">Norm 192</h2>

<p>
    Each individual House has its own fund which consists of all income accruing from working. Mass
    stipends, stole fees, contributions made by the faithful, and other sources of income whether
    made to the Community as a whole or to its individual members. All Monies together with valuable
    documents should be kept in the Monastery safe. These Monies are controlled by the house
    administrator and are under the direction of the Prior used for the needs of the monastery.
</p>
<p>
    Both monasteries as well as individuals who have (with the Superior’s permission) opened bank
    accounts should see to it that authorized individuals are assigned and their names submitted to
    act on their behalf (either the Monastery or the Superior).
</p>


<h2 id="norm193">Norm 193</h2>

<p>
    Superiors of individual Houses may not sell any goods belonging to the Monastery without the
    permission of their Major Superiors except within those parameters which are spelled in the law.
    Furthermore, they may not sell any precious objects even for the benefit of any one of our
    Houses without permission of the Holy See (Canon 638: 1290-1298).
</p>
<p>
    Likewise, the Father General is not able to sell any of the goods belonging to our individual
    Houses or precious objects without the approval of the Apostolic See. The same is true as
    concerns assuming any debts, which amount, are spelled out in Canon Law. On the occasion of
    turning over of the rights of ownership all precepts of Canon and Civil law must be adhered to.
</p>


<h2 id="norm194">Norm 194</h2>

<p>
    Local Superiors as a rule are forbidden to rent any property belonging to the Order. They are
    forbidden likewise to enter into any long term contracts or to incur obligations in the name of
    the institutions, its employees or any other persons.
    Contracts and obligations of this nature should be entered upon with the understanding that they
    will expire within their term of office. If a local Superior desires to incur such obligations
    or make such contracts, which will extend beyond his term of office he must first secure the
    approval of a Major Superior. The local Superiors are also forbidden to incur any type of debt
    without the approval of Major Superior.
</p>


<h2 id="norm195">Norm 195</h2>

<p>
    Funds bequeathed to our Churches and Monasteries, which carry with them certain obligations,
    should be handled with diligence and invested either in real estate or in securities. In these
    matters the precepts of both Canon and Civil Law must be adhered to together with the conditions
    laid down by the benefactors.
</p>
<h2 class="index">The Administrator</h2>

<h2 id="norm196">Norm 196</h2>

<p>
    It lies within the competence of the administrator to take care of the material needs of both
    Monastery and Community. Besides those matters mentioned in Article 165 of the Constitutions it
    is his duty to provide food, clothing, fuel and all other material needs for the Community and
    each of its members. He does this either himself or through Brothers assigned him by the Prior.
</p>
<p>
    The Administrator either personally or through the Brothers will keep careful records as to
    Monies expended and articles procured for individual members of the Community.
</p>


<h2 id="norm197">Norm 197</h2>

<p>
    It is his obligation to familiarize himself with the property of the Monastery and its debts and
    various obligations. He keeps a list of income and expenses in the manner described by the
    General Chapter or by the General Administration.
    He turns over all incoming Monies to the Superior of the House to be deposited in the common
    treasury.
</p>
<p>
    Besides the reports concerning administration and accounting which he presents to the Prior and
    his council at the beginning of each year he should prepare a written report covering the past
    year and sends it to the Major Superior through the Prior.
</p>
<p>
    It is, furthermore, his responsibility to familiarize himself with current legislation both
    ecclesiastical and civil so that he might properly execute those matters connected with his
    office.
</p>

<h2 id="norm198">Norm 198</h2>

<p>
    The Administrator’s responsibilities extend also to the spiritual good of the employees. He
    should not hire anyone without first scrutinising reliable references as to their personal and
    moral life. He should also be concerned to keep their cultural, religious and moral life on a
    high level.
