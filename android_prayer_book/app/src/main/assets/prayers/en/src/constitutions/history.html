<h1 class="index">An Outline of the Historical Development of the Constitutions</h1>

<p>
    It is only proper that, at the beginning of the text of the Constitutions, some attempt should be made to outline in a general way the history of the legislation in the Pauline Community and the principal periods of its development. Five distinct stages are evident as regards the history of the Codification of the Constitutions. The first stage covers the period of the founding of the Order (1308-1309 AD). After a long period of legislative evolution a second Codification was issued (1643-1646) which was based on the Decrees and the recommendations of the Council of Trent. The next draft was issued in 1725. The fourth codification of 1930 was an attempt to align the constitutions with Code of Canon Law which was published in 1917. The Final edition of the Constitutions has been issued in accordance with the recommendations of the Second Vatican Council and in accordance with the Decrees of the new Code of Canon Law promulgated in 1983,
</p>

<h2>The Origins of the Order and its First Statutes</h2>

<p>The origin and development of the Order of St Paul the First Hermit, popularly called the Pauline Order, are intimately connected with the land of Hungary. It was in the Kingdom of St. Stephen that the Order saw itself begin to develop ideological and legislative structures and also enjoyed an unusual period of growth and splendour especially in its first five years. History indicates that the first monastic foundation was made by Bartholomew, the Bishop of Pecs, who in the course of visiting his diocese came across isolated hermits. He himself was a Benedictine associated with the famous Abbey of Cluney. Moved by the desire to reform, he decided to organise a model Monastic Community of Hermits. He was successful in doing just that – gathering them together in a Monastery and Church, which he built for their use, dedicated to St James, on the Mountain of Patacs. (1225) It was he who developed for them their first rule of monastic life.
</p>
<p>
    At about the same time, Eusebius, a Canon of the Cathedral chapter in Esztergom, became interested in the development of eremitical life in the region of the Danube river, much like Bishop Bartholomew. Not only did he make contact with these hermits, supporting them materially and spiritually, but he decided to take up this way of life himself.  With the consent of the Metropolitan of Eztergom, he entered the eremitical life together with several companions in order to give himself more completely to God, through the pursuit of perfection. As a result of personal experiences and mystical phenomena, he came to the conviction that it was necessary to gather together the hermits who were scattered throughout the forests and caves of that region. He built for them a monastery on Mount Pilis, dedicating it and the Church to the Holy Cross. Hence, the first title given to these hermits, now living in community, was “The Hermits of the Holy Cross.” Eusebius, like many of his contemporaries was zealously devoted to the Mother of God, especially under her title of “<em>Patroness of Hungary.</em>” Evidence of this is the fact that besides the beautiful altar erected in honour of the Holy Cross, a second was dedicated to the Mother of God. These hermits were characterised by an uncommon devotion to St. Paul the First Hermit of Thebes. It is for this reason that they chose him as the principal patron of the newly formed religious family. When Eusebius became aware of the community which arose earlier at Patacs, he established contact with the Monastery of St James. Brother Anthony was then the Superior of that monastery, having succeeded Bishop Bartholomew, after his death. From the moment that Eusebius accepted as his own the Rule of the Monks at Patacs, the union of the two communities was realised under the leadership of Eusebius who was chosen as the Provincial. It was in 1263 that the newly formed religious community accepted the common title “<em>Brothers of St. Paul the First Hermit.</em>”
</p>
<p>
    In 1269 Eusebius journeyed to Rome and there met St. Thomas Aquinas who was then living at the Papal Court. It was thanks to the influence of the Holy Doctor, that Eusebius was given an audience with Pope Urban IV, laying before him the petition for approving the new Order and granting it the Rule of St. Augustine. Monastic tradition strongly attests that “<em>Our Blessed Father Eusebius zealously attempted to give our Laws necessary stability. It is for this reason that being in Rome, he petitioned the Holy See to grant us the Rule of St. Augustine as well as approval for the newly organised community. St Thomas Aquinas was a great positive influence.</em>” (cf. <span class="upper">The Introduction to the Constitutions</span>, 17th century) Pope Urban IV was favourably inclined but asked first whether the newly formed Order could support itself. This meeting of Eusebius with the Pope had an immense influence on the life of the Order. Although final Papal approval was still some years away, nevertheless, one can say that the Order officially came into existence by Eusebius formally informing the Apostolic See.
</p>
<p>
    Pope Urban IV officially designated Bishop Paul, Ordinary of Vezprem, to conduct an investigation as to the state and condition of the Pauline Monasteries. His main concern was whether they were indeed capable of supporting themselves. The newly organised hermits living in the Pauline communities were truly poor and owned no material possessions according to the demands of the Rule of St Augustine. As a result, Bishop Paul came to the conclusion that on the basis of his careful examination, the monasteries were not self-sufficient. As a temporary measure he imposed on the Paulines a new and broader Rule which he regarded, by his own admission, as being an expanded version of the first Rule of Bishop Bartholomew. These statutes were expanded by a third rule given by Bishop Andrew, the Ordinary of the Diocese of Eger.
</p>
<p>
    It is evident from this that until the year 1308, Pauline Monasteries came under the various rules given them by Diocesan Bishops. They did not enjoy the official sanction of the Holy See as demanded by the law of the Church at that time. Rather their approval was dependant on that of the bishops of whose diocese they were.
</p>
<p>
    Official approval came from Rome in 1308. Cardinal Gentilis, legate of Pope Clement V, acting on behalf of the Apostolic See, officially approved the Order of St. Paul the First Hermit, placing it under the Rule of St. Augustine. Formal recognition of the Order by the Apostolic See resulted from not only the efforts and petitions of the Paulines themselves but through the favourable opinion which it enjoyed by many Bishops, and the King of Hungary, Charles I. (of Anjou) It was through the intercession of the King that special privileges were also granted to the Order.
</p>
<p>
    The fact that the Order received the Rule of St. Augustine, which was the common legacy of many other Orders, did not complete the history of the Order, as regards legislation. Besides the general norm for monastic life found in the rule of St. Augustine, it was soon evident that there was a need for more precise precepts or Constitutions which would spell out the basic characteristics of the spiritual life  and the specific apostolic mission of the Order, thereby becoming an efficient means of sanctification for the monks.
</p>
<p>
    Therefore, the Pauline Community petitioned Cardinal Gentilis for permission to write the Constitutions. By the powers granted him by Pope Clement V, the Cardinal-Legate acceded to their wish by a special decree authorising them at the next Chapter to begin work on the first Constitutions. The Chapter was convened during the Octave of Pentecost in 1309 in the newly built Monastery of St. Lawrence near Buda. From this time on, this monastery became the centre of the life of Order. Heading the Chapter was the Provincial, Lawrence, the fourth successor of Blessed Eusebius. At the conclusion of the Chapter, which was in fact the first General chapter in our history, Cardinal Gentilis elevated him to the rank of the first General of the Order, as our Chronicles testify. The first constitutions issued by the Chapter contained the rule of Bishops Bartholomew, Paul and Andrew, as the ideas and spirit, which the hermits held in common, living now a Community life. As future ages will attest, the Constitutions at the Chapter of 1309 were in no way a closed law. Individual General Chapters were authorised to amend these first statutes with new one according to the changing needs of life. Contained in these first Constitutions, now Papally approved, were titles and privileges granted to our Order during this period. Monastic tradition tells us that our spiritual forefathers, on account of their holiness of life, were held in great esteem by popes, bishops and princes, other leaders, and society in general.  Because of this, they were universally regarded as true Holy Monks. St. John Capistrano who lived in Italy in the 16th Century, said regarding our brethren: “If anyone wishes to see living saints, let him come to the Monastery of Marianostrza and he will be satisfied.” Similar opinions were held about our fathers in other monasteries. It is no wonder then that our brethren were regarded with such respect and reference not only in life, but also even after death. Out of a spirit of humility and monastic modesty, the Order was never concerned that its holy ones be recognized as Blessed or Saints.
</p>
<p>
    As an expression of respect for the holiness and inspiration given by our brethren, there are many Papal Bulls, which endowed the Order with special privileges and spiritual graces. This happiest period of our Order’s development and popularity came to end with the first invasions and wars involving the Turks. Then came the Protestant Reformation. Because of the Turkish wars and incursions, our monasteries were devastated and our monks murdered. This was the fate of one of our most famous monasteries of St. Lawrence near Buda, which was the seat of our Generals and the centre of the life of the Order. It was at this time also that the relics of St. Paul the First Hermit, which had been solemnly transferred there, were burned. The most tragic of battles as to its effects was the defeat of the Hungarian army at Hochacz in 1526. Scores of Pauline Monasteries were destroyed. Archives and libraries were burnt and monks were led of martyrdom.
</p>
<p>
    What these incursions did not succeed in destroying, the Reformation did, coming to Hungary at this time with such a great ferocity. The Paulines resisted the encroachment of the Reformation with one mind. The General’s residence was transferred to Lepoglay and then to Maria Thal (from Hungarian Mariology – today Marianka in Solvakia).
</p>
<p>
    When we consider the next oldest Pauline Constitutions, we can say in general that they were not a systemised code. Rather, they were a simple collection of statutes, which were added on successively. It does, however, constitute a practical guide and a unified form of life of the Paulines of that era. Alongside the legal organisation of the Pauline Order, one can sense from these original statutes a certain understanding as to the Orders’ charism and spirituality under which these first Paulines lived. For example, it was an Order originally eremitical. Evidence of this was the practise of building its houses in isolated places for the purpose of cultivating solitude. These houses were characterised by a life of piety and severity, filled with prayer, penance and work – work that was principally physical at the beginning and became pastoral, especially with their own Churches. It was in this way that our Order moulded its particular style of living out the ideals set forth by its patriarch and Father, Paul the First Hermit, according to the changing conditions of life – formerly purely eremitical, now monastic. One can see from this the beginnings of a definite spirituality based on the Mystery of the Cross. As regards the Marian spirit of the Order during this period, its main expression would take the form of devotion to the Mother of God as the Patroness and Great Lady of Hungary. It is very characteristic of our Order that from its earliest days, it assumed the care of famous Marian Shrines. In addition, together with devotion to St. Paul the First Hermit, devotion to the Holy Guardian Angels, enjoyed wide appeal. As regards the liturgy, it was only at the General Chapter of Lepoglav in 1600 that the reform of the breviary and Roman Missal ordered by the Council of Trent were accepted. We can see from this that the Pauline’s enjoyed their own proper Liturgy as well as their own liturgical books. (The Pauline Breviary was published in 1540 and the Pauline Missal published in Venice in 1537 by the Pauline Cardinal Jerzy Matinuzzi)
</p>

<h2>The Second Edition of the Constitutions Based on the Decrees and Recommendations of the Council of Trent</h2>

<p>
    Community life underwent serious change towards the end of the 16<sup>th</sup> and the beginnings of the 17<sup>th</sup> Centuries. The causes and reasons for this were many. This was the reason why our Order desired and was concerned for a revision of the temporary statutes based on the Decrees of the Council of Trent. The General Chapter, which was convened at Maria Thal in 1632, undertook the project of renewing the Constitutions. Work began under the aegis of the first Pole to be chosen General of the Order. Father Marcin Gruszkowicz was young, zealous and enlightened. It was he who initiated not only the preliminary steps for this task, but undertook the reform of the religious life itself. As he visited the various monasteries, he informed the Monks of the proposed reform of the Constitutions. He met with much opposition and discontent on the part of many monks as he explained to them the proposed changes and reforms. All this, despite the hopes for the renewal of the life of the Order and the fact that the initiative had come from the monastic community itself. This was especially true of the Polish province, which had earlier undertaken a broader from of Apostolic Work as the needs of the time demanded.
</p>
<p>
    The sudden death of the Order’s General, Fr Marcin Gruszkowicz, while not cancelling, did certainly delay the beginning of our Order’s renewal and the revision of its Constitutions. Father Mikolaj Staszewski took up this project with the greatest difficulty. Since he was not able to obtain unanimity as regards this proposed project, he decided to send all the material together with the original Constitutions and actual Laws together with corrections and suggestions to Rome.
</p>
<p>
    The Special Commission created by the Sacred Congregation for the purpose of revising the Constitutions consisted of two cardinals and ten renowned canon lawyers. They were amazed at the enormity of the material, which they received. They had expected to receive the finalized version of the proposed project prepared for their examination and approval. Nonetheless, the commission undertook the work. Pope Urban VIII himself, in his Bull approving the Constitutions, stressed the fact that the commission completed its task in thirty-three sessions. The Commission entrusted with the revision worked on the basic assumption that even in the interest of the Apostolate, the essential character of the Order as eremitical-contemplative as well as its severe discipline must be maintained, this despite the suggestions presented by various provinces and responsible individuals. Already at the beginning of the year 1643 Francis Ignoli, the secretary for the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith (under whose jurisdiction monastic matters fell) presented the new Constitutions of the Pauline Order for approval to Pope Urban VIII who acceded to his request on May 4, 1643. He next authorised their publication in Rome. This hasty publication resulted in a great number of textual errors. In addition to the burden of great expenditure of time and money, most of the copies were lost while in sea transit with only a few remaining.
</p>
<p>
    It was only at the General Chapter convened on the 12<sup>th</sup> of September 1644 in the Monastery of St. Wolfgang near Bratislava under the leadership of the newly elected General, Father Marcin Borkowicz, that the new Constitutions were accepted and promulgated as binding. They incorporated also certain corrections with the consent of the Apostolic See. The finalised printing of the Constitutions took place in Vienna in the year 1646, after which they were sent to the individual Provinces. Most notable in these Constitutions is a certain rigorism, which can be traced to the spirit of the Decrees of the Council of Trent, in turn caused by the Council’s desire to defend religious life against certain very real threats and dangers.
</p>
<p>
    The new constitutions can be regarded as a well-defined, systematic and logical codex. They also include guidelines for pastoral ministry and outlined the obligations of confessors and preachers.  This new Codex of Pauline Life is basically rooted in the old Constitutions and Pauline traditions. It is very clear in stating that the life of the Pauline Community must be rounded out by prayer as well as by the severe practices of the Desert Fathers together with works of penance and labour, not only physical but intellectual and pastoral as well.
    The new Constitutions complied with such difficulty and brought to life, not without opposition, became the basis of a gradual renewal and spiritual rebirth in the Order which has had its share of tragedy and which tragedies were reflected in the severely weakened structure of the Pauline Order. Before long, the effectiveness of the renewed rules could be seen in the persons of illustrious monks and in their deeds. At the same time, this was all preparing the Order for new trials.
</p>
<p>
    It was at this time that the Marian cult developed in a unique fashion. Its centre was Jasna Gora, which was already famous throughout the whole Order.  There was growth also in the Cult of St. Paul the First Hermit and of the Holy Guardian Angels. This is reflected not only in the Constitutions but also in the apostolic labours of all the monasteries. The renewed Pauline Constitutions were a help also in improving the methods of formation and developing monastic studies – all in the spirit of the Council of Trent. Already in the year 1563, the General of the Order, Pawel Iwanowicz, organised the first Pauline Seminary in Tyrnaw. In the year 1669 because of Papal privileges and the order of Emperor Leopold, the seminary was changed into a <em>Studium Generale</em>. Before long, this course of study produced very evident results. The intellectual level of the Monks was decidedly raised and despite the continuing invasions of the Turks in the Balkans and the Swedish aggression in Poland, the Provinces of the Order reached a new height of greatness and became an integral part of public life. The Order became famous for its centres of learning and publication that included a participation in parochial, educational and missionary endeavours.
</p>

<h2>The Third Edition of the Constitutions of the Order</h2>

<p>
    The Constitutions issued in the year 1646 were subject to constant additions and corrections. As a result, in the first half of the 18<sup>th</sup> century the need for an exact revision was evident. Alongside the original text, there were many authentic interpretations, which had to be taken into account. Moreover, many of the older texts became worn from use spanning nearly a hundred years. In addition, times had changed along with the conditions of life.
</p>
<p>
    The call for a reform of the constitutions came from within the Order as well. At the election of Father General Chryzostom Kozbialowicz at the General Chapter in 1721, the Chapter Fathers took up the matter of the importance of a speedy revision. It is no wonder that the General Chapter gathered at Maria Thal in 1724 gave special priority to the matter of revising the Constitutions. Their main concern was to explain doubtful passages, to make corrections where needed, and to amend the interpretations coming from the Apostolic See up to that time, whilst maintaining the essential character of the old Constitutions. The proposed changes, additions and corrections were sent to the Apostolic See with the request for approval and permission for a new edition of the Constitutions. After receiving the approval of the Apostolic See on the 13<sup>th</sup> of May 1725, the revised Constitutions were published in Rome. On this occasion the Father General Chryzostom Kozbialowicz circulated, a letter throughout the Order and at the General Chapter of Maria Thal 1727 promulgated the new Constitutions. It was officially agreed upon to send three copies to each Monastery and to preserve the copies of the old Constitutions in the archives or the library. While the newly published constitutions were not essentially different from the former in the manner of formulation, they were without a doubt an improvement as regards monastic codification as well as being a practical update of the laws. As a whole, in comparison with the former Constitutions these were even better divided as to themes and offered a more logical arrangement of the points. They still lacked a clear vision as to the purpose, obligations, character and mission of the Order &mdash; those elements which define its unique character.
</p>
<p>
    Along with the Constitutions, the Directory was published in the year 1736, along with the <em>Ratio Studiorum</em>. These served as sources for acquainting oneself with the spirit, traditions and customs of the Order.
</p>
<p>
    Following the revision and renewal of the Constitutions in the year 1725, the Order enjoyed a period of good fortune and development. The political, social and religious conditions of that time helped to bring this about. Although this time of growth was not to be long-lived, the Order continued to receive new privileges and titles from the Holy See. The Pauline monks enjoyed a universal respect and acclaim for their manner of life.
</p>
<p>
    Eventually, however, The Order was to come to the very brink of ruin because of unfortunate political conditions. Emperor Joseph II by a Decree on February 27<sup>th</sup>, 1786 liquidated the Order in all territories of his empire. A similar fate met the Order under Prussian rule (1813) and under Russian rule. (1864)
</p>
<p>
    Out of all the Pauline Monasteries only two survived and these were separated because of the partition of Poland. Jasna Gora found itself under Russian rule and the Monastery at Skalka, in Krakow, was under Austrian. To make matter worse, Jasna Gora became a so-called “Permanent Monastery” made up of a specifically allotted number of monks, thereby becoming practically speaking, destined for annihilation. In the course of time, new candidates were received, each one requiring specific permission to enter from the governor. This became the saddest period in the annals of the Pauline Order. However, from a human perspective the only source of hope for the Order was Our Lady of Jasna Gora, our unfailing protectress and Mother of the Order.
</p>

<h2>Constitutions of the Order Renewed and Approved by Pope Pius xi In 1930</h2>

<p>
    After an interval of nearly 150 years, a General Chapter was called in 1920. The Chapter members decided that after nearly 200 years of existence and in the light of the changed conditions of life, the Constitutions of 1725 needed a thorough reform. In addition to this, the codification of Canon Law in the code of 1917, urged all religious to conform their Constitutions to the Code. As a result, work on the updating of our monastic laws began in the year 1922. The General of the Order, Fr. Piotr Markiewicz, was entrusted with this project. Fr. Pius Przezdziecki and Fr. Vincent Olszewicz, Definitor General, were assigned to assist him. This new Codification of the Pauline Constitutions was to be based first on the Constitutions of 1725, on the Directory issued in 1736 as well as on the Decrees of the Visitors, the New Code of Canon Law and all the prescriptions issue in this regard by the Apostolic See.  The project underwent serious discussion at the General Chapter from October 27, 1926 to January 20, 1927 in the course of eighty-seven meetings. After undergoing certain corrections, the results were submitted for approval to the Apostolic See. The Constitutions which were the result of enormous efforts were submitted first to the Sacred Congregation for Religious Affairs. After appropriate corrections, they received final approval from Pope Pius XI on the 29th of May, 1930. Next, the General of the Order announced through a letter to the whole Order, that the Constitutions were approved and promulgated. They would become binding on the Solemnity of St. Paul the First Hermit in the year 1931. This new Codification of the revised Constitutions, which represented the efforts of a special commission and the General Chapter, and later amended by the Sacred Congregation, proved in general to be satisfactory. It was divided into three sections in order to preserve the former systematic division. For the first time a Chapter on the purpose of the Order was included as an introduction in conformity with the wishes of the Congregation. The initial articles attempted to make a connection with the spirit of the Old Constitutions and essentially to explain the beginnings and character of the Order.
</p>
<p>
    The Constitutions Codified in the year 1930 remained in force up until our time. As the year went by, prompted by the constantly changing conditions of life, the General Chapter added various clarifications in the form of resolutions. Some of these were of a temporary nature and soon became outdated. Those, which remained, retained their permanent value.
</p>
<p>
    Based on the conditions existing follow the Second World War, the General of the Order, Fr. Piotr Markiewicz, acceding to the wishes of the General Chapter, called into being a Special Commission for revision in the year 1951. This commission prepared corrections to certain articles in the Constitutions and undertook the project of creating a new Directory, or the so called customary of the Order, which it presented to the General Chapter in 1952. The Chapter incorporated some of these in its resolutions and commissioned further work to be undertaken for the fundamental revision of the Constitutions.
</p>

<h1 class="index">The Constitutions Drafted in the Spirit of the Second Vatican Council and Approved by the Apostolic see In 1986</h1>

<p>
    The Second Vatican Council, it its Constitutions and Decrees, especially the Decree Perfectae Caritatis enjoined all religious communities to conform their constitutions to its resolutions <em>Accommodate Renovatio</em>. It marked out in its accompanying statutes, guidelines for bring this renewal about.
</p>
<p>
    The Father General of the Order, Jerzy Tomzinski, by a letter of January 25<sup>th</sup>, 1967, called into being a special “Central Committee for the Renewal of the Constitutions in the light of the Council.” This Commission created a series of subcommittees (doctrinal, religious life, studies, formation, pastoral, liturgical and government) and thus began its preparatory work.
</p>
<p>
    Guided by the recommendations of this same Decree concerning the renewal of religious life, the Commission was determined first and foremost to return to the basic foundations of the original spirituality and mission of the Order. It sought to bring these foundations in line with the teachings of the Council and with the conditions of contemporary society and the signs of our times. The entire Pauline Community was given the opportunity to express itself in the matter of our religious rules by means of a very detailed questionnaire. The completed project was thoroughly discussed at the General Chapter, expressly called for this purpose, and which deliberated during two sessions – one from January 16th to February 27<sup>th</sup>, 1971, and the other from January 17<sup>th</sup> to March 4<sup>th</sup>, 1972.
</p>
<p>
    The members of the Chapter had the opportunity to become acquainted with the requests of the Community as their work proceeded. They were also able to take advantage of the work of other Orders in this same regard. The project of the renewed Constitutions according to the spirit of Vatican II with the General Directory as the fruit of an intense work on the part of the Chapter was submitted by the <em>Definitorium Generale</em> for the approval and eventual recommendation to the Sacred Congregation for Religious and Secular Institutes in its Polish and Latin Version. It was sent to Rome on the 15<sup>th</sup> of January, 1973.
</p>
<p>
    As early as the 26<sup>th</sup> of February 1973, the Sacred Congregation approved <em>ad experimentum</em> the renewed Constitutions. It also notified by written approbation that the <em>Directorium Generale</em> had also been examined. It made certain recommendations to both texts in the form of suggestions, which the <em>Definitorium Generale</em> incorporated into the edition of the Constitutions and the General Directory.
    The renewed and ratified Constitutions and the General Directory were promulgated by a Decree of the Father General of the Order, Jerzy Tomzinski, on the 31<sup>st</sup> of May 1973. They took effect on the Solemnity of Our Lady of Jasna Gora, on the 26<sup>th</sup> of August 1973.
    It is worth mentioning that the Sacred Congregation for Religious Institutes and Secular Institutes took special notice of the great efforts exerted in renewing the Constitutions on the 26<sup>th</sup> of July, 1973. We can read, “The Sacred Congregation offers hearty congratulations for the labours exerted by the Chapters which have brought about such a faithful revision in accordance with the Decrees of the Second Vatican Council and the Holy See in the matter of renewing religious life to the needs of our times. The Sacred Congregation further hopes that the work of this General Chapter might serve to promote the spiritual development and make more effective Ministry of the Order.” Following the suggestions of the Sacred Congregation, the General Chapter of 1975 created a special commission for matters pertaining to the Constitutions. On this occasion of the publication of the new Code of Canon Law on the 25<sup>th</sup> of January, 1983, the General of the Order increased the membership of this Commission and entrusted to it a very serious mandate – to make suitable observations as to the Constitutions in the light of the new Code. Next, the General Chapter for Elections held in 1984 at the conclusion of ordinary business, undertook intensive work for the examination of the Constitutions’ binding until now. It benefited greatly from the recommendations of the aforementioned Commission as well as from the precepts of the New Code. It was responsible for many recommendations, corrections and clarifications. It charged the <em>Definitorium Generale</em>, together with the Commission for Matters pertaining to the Constitutions, to prepare a finalized text for presentations to the Apostolic See for final approval. Father Pawel Kosiak prepared the Latin text of the Constitutions. His dedicated efforts of translating the Polish into Latin won special commendation from the Sacred Congregation.
</p>
<p>
    The <em>Definitorium Generale</em>, in accordance with the mandate of the General Chapter of 1984, assisted by the Commission for Matters appertaining to the Constitutions, prepared the Polish and Latin text, which the General of the Order personally delivered to the Holy See for approval on the 4<sup>th</sup> of March, 1985. The Sacred Congregation acting through the Procurator General at the Holy See, Fr. Stanislaw Turek, made several proposals as to corrections which the <em>Definitorium Generale</em> incorporated into the texts of the new Constitutions. In their finalized form, the Constitutions were approved by the Sacred Congregation in a letter, dated the 26th of August, 1986, which was addressed to the General of the Order, Fr. Jozef Platek.
</p>
<p>
    This examination of the five historical periods of the Codification of the Pauline Constitutions makes evident that the finalised version of the Constitutions, renewed in the spirit of the Decrees of Vatican II and in agreement with the precepts in the new Code of Canon Law, faithfully maintains the inner character and undisturbed current of the spirituality of the Order, which has been received and handed on through each preceding revision. It is, thanks to this, that our Monastic Community has retained its identity until today. We can only stand in wonder at the care and wisdom of the individual editors both Monastic and Roman, as regards our Constitutions, but most of all we wonder at the exceptional assistance rendered by the Holy Spirit. It is thanks to His Grace, that our Order has been able to retain its own spirituality and mission despite the constantly changing conditions of life and in the face of new situations and new possibilities for development.
</p>
<p>
    These Constitutions undertake at the very beginning to consider in a concise way, the character of our Order, the hallmarks of our spirituality, together with our rich heritage and historical evolution. They describe also the inner and exterior mission of the Order. We have a clear and accurate outline of Pauline Spirituality as well as a description of the depths and value of the Consecrated Monastic Life, which comes about through the profession of the Evangelical Counsels. Beside the love of liturgy and personal prayer coupled with a life of penance, which is characteristic of our Pauline Vocation, we have described for us in these Constitutions for the first time the wide scope of Our Lady’s place in the life of Our Order.  Our Lady’s place, a fact in the long history of our Order, has now become for us a binding way of life.
</p>
<p>
    We are aware, however, that even the most perfect law cannot attain its purpose unless it is put into practice daily by those whom it binds. Even the most sacred rules remain dead letters unless they are translated into daily living.
    Dear Brothers, I present to you the new Constitutions approved by the authority of the Apostolic See with the hope that you will receive them in a generous spirit as you carry out the noble mission of our Order.
