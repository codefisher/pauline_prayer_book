<h1>4. Evening Prayers</h1>

<p class="instruction">
    Vespers should be recited at the time stated in the daily
    monastery horarium. Followed by the Invocations to St. Paul.
    Next, the Superior recalls the names of the deceased Brothers for
    the following day and concludes with a prayer for the dead.
    Depending on the daily horarium the “Angelus” should be
    recited at the beginning of the Evening Prayers or after supper.
