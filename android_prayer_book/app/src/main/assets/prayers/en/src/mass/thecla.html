    Tecla is thought to have come from Iconium. She was said to have received Baptism from St Paul
    the Apostle during his first journey through Asia Minor (the years 45-49). She made a vow of
    Chasity and remained unmarried. She accompanied St Paul in his journeys, ministering to him. She
    is supposedly to have lived long life, well into her 80s, of which she spent a significant
    amount as a hermit.

    O God, for the glory of your name blessed Thecla, virgin and martyr,
    withstood the great contest of sufferings
    with her faith unconquered,
    grant to us in imitation of the her faith
    to despise the success of the world
    and to tremble at none of its adversity.
    Through our Lord Jesus Christ your Son,
    who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
    one God, for ever and ever.
</litany>
