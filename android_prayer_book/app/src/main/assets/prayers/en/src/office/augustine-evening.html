<h2>Evening Prayer</h2>

<reading label="Hymn"></reading>

<psalm>
    For all the saints who from their labours rest,
    Who thee by faith before the world confest,
    They name, O Jesu, be for ever blest.
    Alleluia! Alleluia!

    Thou wast their rock, their fortress and their might;
    Thou, Lord, their captain in the well-fought fight;
    Thou in the darkness drear their one true Light.
    Alleluia! Alleluia!

    O may thy soldiers, faithful, true and bold,
    Fight as the saints who nobly fought of old,
    And win, with them, the victor's crown of gold.
    Alleluia! Alleluia!

    O blest communion! fellowship divine!
    We fight as they did &rsquo;neath the holy sign;
    And all are one in thee, for all are thine.
    Alleluia! Alleluia!

    Lord, whó shall be admítted to your tént *
    - and dwéll on your hóly móuntain?

    Hé who wálks without fáult; *

    who hólds the gódless in disdáin, *

    hé who keeps his plédge, come what máy; +

    - and accépts no bríbes against the ínnocent.
    Such a mán will stand fírm for éver.

    Happy the mán who féars the Lórd, *
    - who tákes delíght in all his commánds.
    His sóns will be pówerful on éarth; *
    - the chíldren of the úpright are bléssed.

    Ríches and wéalth are in his hóuse; *
    - his jústice stands fírm for éver.
    He is a líght in the dárkness for the úpright: *
    - he is génerous, mérciful and júst.

    The góod man takes píty and lénds, *
    - he condúcts his affáirs with hónour.
    The júst man will néver wáver: *

    He has no féar of évil néws; *
    - with a fírm heart he trústs in the Lórd.
    With a stéadfast héart he will not féar; *

    Open-hánded, he gíves to the póor; +

<reading label="Scripture Reading" ref="1 Peter 5:1-4"></reading>

<p>
    Now I have something to tell you elders: I am an elder myself, and a witness to the sufferings of Christ, and with you I have a share in the glory that is to be revealed. Be the shepherds of the flock of God that is entrusted to you: watch over it, not simply as a duty but gladly, because God wants it; not for sordid money, but because you are eager to do it. Never be a dictator over any group that is put in your charge, but be an example that the whole flock can follow. When the chief shepherd appears, you will be given the crown of unfading glory.

    My soul glórifies the Lórd, *

    Let us pray to Christ, the high priest, who was appointed to represent men in their relations with God: <br />  <sp>R/</sp> <em>Lord, save your people.</em>
    Lord Jesus, in times past you have lighted the way for your people through wise and holy leaders;
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span> may Christians always enjoy this sign of your loving kindness.&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>
    You forgave the sins of your people when holy pastors prayed;
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span>  continually cleanse your Church through their powerful intercession.&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>
    In the presence of their brothers, you anointed your holy ones and poured on them your Spirit;
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span>  fill with your Holy Spirit all the leaders of your people.&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>
    Nothing could ever separate the holy pastors from your love;
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span> do not lose even one of those whom you redeemed by your passion.&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>
    Through the pastors of your Church you give your sheep eternal life, and no one can steal them from you;
    <span class="rubric">&mdash;</span> save the faithful departed, for whom you laid down your life.&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>

<reading label="Concluding Prayer"></reading>

<litany>Lord God, renew your Church
    with the Spirit of wisdom and love
    which you gave so fully to Saint Augustine.
    Lead us by that same Spirit to seek you,
    the only fountain of true wisdom
    and the source of everlasting love.
    Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
    who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
    one God, for ever and ever.
</litany>
