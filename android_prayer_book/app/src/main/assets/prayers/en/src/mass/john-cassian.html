<h2><span class="rubric">Memorial</span></h2>

<p><em>
    John Cassian was born around 360 AD, most likely in modern Romania. When he was 20, he came to
    Palestine and became a monk in one of the monasteries in Bethlehem. Next, he spent 10 years in
    Egypt among the monks there, where he came to know renowned masters of the eremitical life. Then
    in the years following he lived in Rome. There he received priestly orders and befriended the
    future Pope Leo the Great. Around 415, he founded two monasteries, one for monks (St Victor’s)
    and another for Virgins (The Saviour’s).

    O God who in Saint John Cassian
    have given us an example of evangelical perfection,
    grant we beseech you amidst the trials of our life
    we may love the truths of heaven with our whole heart.
    Through our Lord Jesus Christ your Son,
    who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
    one God, for ever and ever.
</litany>
