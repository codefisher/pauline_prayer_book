    O God who in Saint John Cassian
    have given us an example of evangelical perfection,
    grant we beseech you amidst the trials of our life
    we may love the truths of heaven with our whole heart.
    Through our Lord Jesus Christ your Son,
    who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
    one God, for ever and ever.
</litany>
