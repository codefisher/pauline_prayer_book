<h2><span class="rubric">Memorial</span></h2>

<p><em>
    John Cassian was born around AD 360, most likely in modern Romania. When he was twenty, he came to
    Palestine and became a monk in one of the monasteries in Bethlehem. Next, he spent ten years in
    Egypt among the monks there, where he came to know renowned masters of the eremitical life. Then,
    in the years following, he lived in Rome. There he received priestly orders and befriended the
    future Pope Leo the Great. Around 415, he founded two monasteries, one for monks (Saint Victor’s)
    and another for virgins (The Saviour’s).

    O God who in Saint John Cassian
    have given us an example of evangelical perfection,
    grant, we beseech you that amidst the trials of our life
    we may love the truths of heaven with our whole heart.
    Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
    who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
    one God, for ever and ever.
