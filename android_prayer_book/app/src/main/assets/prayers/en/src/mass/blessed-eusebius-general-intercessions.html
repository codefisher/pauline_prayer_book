<reading label="Introduction"></reading>

<p>
    My brothers and sisters, as we joyfully celebrate the
    feast of Blessed Eusebius founder of the Pauline Order, we turn our hearts to God the Father and ask him to pour out
    abundant graces on the Church and the world from the treasury of Christâ€™s love.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>For our Holy Father, our bishops and priests, and all the leaders of the church, that they
        may attain sanctity and be perfectly conformed to our Lord Jesus Christ.
        <br/>Let us pray to the Lord.
    </li>

    <li>For the Pauline Fathers and Brothers who generously follow the example of Blessed Eusebius, that they
        may be endowed with wisdom and brought to perfection in the Lord Jesus.
        <br/>Let us pray to the Lord.
    </li>

    <li>For vocations to the Pauline Order; that many young men may take on the challenge of priestly
        ministry and religious life, and that the Lord of the harvest may send out more labourers
        into the harvest.
        <br/>Let us pray to the Lord.
    </li>
    <li>For all who are in need of special prayer today, especially the confraters and benefactors
        of the Pauline Order, that through the intercession of Blessed Eusebius they
        may dwell in the shelter of the Most High and find refuge beneath His wings.
        <br/>Let us pray to the Lord.
    </li>
    <li>For all of us who participate in this Holy Sacrifice, that we who receive the source of
        wisdom in Jesus may be wise and loving in our dealings with one another.
        <br/>Let us pray to the Lord.
    </li>
    <li>For all our departed loved ones, especially the Pauline Fathers and Brothers, that they may
        see the heavens opened and the angels of God descending to carry them up to the Son of God.
        <br/>Let us pray to the Lord.
    </li>
</ol>

    <p>
        O God, our heavenly Father, you have given Blessed Eusebius to us as a model of trust in you.
        We ask you to listen to our prayers and
        to assist us in our needs. Grant that we may find happiness in devoting ourselves to your
        service and that of the Church, and may one day, with Mary and all the saints, rejoice in
        the kingdom of heaven where you live for ever and ever. <br/> Amen.
    </p>
