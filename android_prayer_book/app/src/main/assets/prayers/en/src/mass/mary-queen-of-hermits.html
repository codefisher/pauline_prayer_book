		Let the wilderness and the dry-lands exult,
		let the wasteland rejoice and bloom,
		let it bring forth flowers like the jonquil,
		let it rejoice and sing for joy.

		The glory of Lebanon is bestowed on it,
		the splendour of Carmel and Sharon;

	<litany includeblank="includeblank">
		It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,
		always and everywhere to give you thanks,
		Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God,
		on this commemoration of the Virgin Mary Queen of Hermits.

		For she herself is the Virgin who listens
		who in the silence of her heart
		received with spousal love the incarnation of your Son.

		Overflowing with this same grace she visited Elizabeth
		in whose womb John,
		&ldquo;the voice of one crying in the desert,&rdquo;
		was made to leap for joy.

		Moreover when in Egypt with the pursued Christ
		she fled as an exile to the desert.

		Within the home of the family of Nazareth
		she lived in silent contemplation
		meditating in her own soul the wisdom of Jesus.

		But in the hour of her greatest desolation
		when she stood at the foot of the cross of your Son,
		by the strength of your Spirit
		she confirmed the mission of her maternal protection of the Church????.

		For this reason, holy Father,
		by your gift we call her Queen and Mother,
		that our Order might always be an equally faithful witness to your son.

		Through him the host of Angles adores your majesty
		and rejoices in your presence for ever.
		May our voices, we pray, join with theirs,
		in one chorus of exultant praise, as we acclaim:

		Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
		Heaven and earth are full of your glory.
		Hosanna in the highest.
		Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
		Hosanna in the highest.

	they who drink me will thirst for more.  
	Whoever listens to me will never have to blush, 
	whoever acts as I dictate will never sin.</litany>

	<litany>Lord God, grant that we who are nourished

	and the intercession of Our Mother and Queen, 
	may serve more and more faithfully the mystery of Redemption.
	Through Christ our Lord.</litany>
