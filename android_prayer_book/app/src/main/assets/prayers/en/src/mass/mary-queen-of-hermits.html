	<litany includeblank="includeblank" class="strong">
		It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,
		always and everywhere to give you thanks,
		Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God,
		on this commemoration of the Virgin Mary Queen of Hermits.

		For she is that Virgin who obediently
		in the silence of her heart
		received with spousal love the incarnation of your Son.

		Overflowing with this same grace, she visited Elizabeth,
		in whose womb she caused John,
		&ldquo;the voice of one crying in the desert,&rdquo;
		to leap for joy.

		Moreover, when in Egypt with the pursued Christ,
		she traversed the desert as an exile.

		Within the home of the family of Nazareth
		she lived in silent contemplation
		meditating in her own soul the wisdom of Jesus.

		But in the hour of her greatest desolation
		when she stood at the foot of the cross of your Son,
		by the strength of your Spirit
		she confirmed her role, her motherhood of the Church.

		For this reason, holy Father,
		by your gift we call her Queen and Mother,
		so that our Order may always be an equally faithful witness to your son.

		Through him the host of Angels adores your majesty
		and rejoices in your presence for ever.
		May our voices, we pray, join with theirs
		in one chorus of exultant praise, as we acclaim:

		Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
		Heaven and earth are full of your glory.
		Hosanna in the highest.
		Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
		Hosanna in the highest.

	<h2 class="rubric">Communion Antiphon  <span class="ref">Sir 24:21-22</span></h2>
	<litany>They who eat me will hunger for more, 
	they who drink me will thirst for more.  
	Whoever listens to me will never have to blush, 
	whoever acts as I dictate will never sin.</litany>

	<h2 class="rubric">Prayer after Communion</h2>
	<litany>
		Lord, grant that we, nourished by the springs of salvation,
		and supported by the power of this Sacrament
		and the intercession of our Mother and Queen,
		may serve more faithfully day by day the mystery of our redemption.
		Through Christ our Lord.
	</litany>
