<h2>Prayer During the Day</h2>

<reading label="Hymn"></reading>

<psalm>
    God, who made the earth and sky
    And the changing sea,
    Clothed his glory in our flesh:
    Man, with men to be.

    Mary, Virgin filled with light,
    Chosen from our race,
    Bore the Father’s only Son
    By the Spirit’s grace.

    He whom nothing can contain,
    No one can compel,
    Bound his timeless Godhead here,
    In our time to dwell.

    God, our Father, Lord of days,
    And his only Son,
    With the Holy Spirit praise:
    Trinity in One.
</psalm>

<h3>Before Noon</h3>


<reading label="Short Reading" ref="Acts 5:17-20"></reading>

<p>
    The high priest intervened with all his supporters from the party of the Sadducees. Prompted by jealousy, they arrested the apostles and had them put in the common gaol. But at night the angel of the Lord opened the prison gates and said as he led them out, ‘Go and stand in the Temple, and tell the people all about this new Life.’
</p>

<p class="noindent">
    <sp>V/</sp> I shall sing to you,my God, in the presence of the angels.
    <br />
    <sp>R/</sp> I shall worship in your sanctuary, and bear witness to your name.
</p>

<h3>Midday</h3>


<reading label="Short Reading" ref="Acts 12:7"></reading>

<p>
    Then suddenly the angel of the Lord stood there, and the cell was filled with light. He tapped Peter on the side and woke him. ‘Get up!’ he said ‘Hurry!’ – and the chains fell from his hands.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
    <sp>V/</sp> The Lord sent his angel,
    <br />
    <sp>R/</sp> Who freed me from the power of Herod.
</p>

<h3>Afternoon</h3>

<reading label="Short Reading" ref="Acts 10:3-5"></reading>

<p>
    One day at about the ninth hour he had a vision in which he distinctly saw the angel of God come into his house and call out to him, ‘Cornelius!’ He stared at the vision in terror and exclaimed, ‘What is it, Lord?’ ‘Your offering of prayers and alms’, the angel answered, ‘has been accepted by God. Now you must send someone to Jaffa and fetch a man called Simon, known as Peter.’
</p>

<p class="noindent">
    <sp>V/</sp> The fragrant incense of the prayer of the saints went up in the Lord’s presence.
    <br />
    <sp>R/</sp> It rose up in the sight of God from the angel’s hand.
</p>

<reading label="Concluding Prayer"></reading>

<litany>Lord God,
    in your all-wise providence you send angels to guard and protect us.
    Surround us with their watchful care on earth,
    and give us the joy of their company for ever in heaven.
    Through Christ Our Lord.
</litany>
