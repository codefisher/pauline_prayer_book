<h1 class="index">Chapter II: The Formation of Novices</h1>


<h2 id="art69">Article 69</h2>

<p>
    The Novitiate is one and at the same time a school of religious Life and a test of one’s
    vocation. It has as its purpose the development of both the human and Christian aspects of one’s
    personality as well as the initiation into the Pauline’s Religious formation.
</p>
<p>
    The period of Novitiate in our Order for aspirants to the priesthood lasts one year; two years
    for the preparing for the Brotherhood, the first of which is considered the canonical year.
</p>


<h2 id="art70">Article 70</h2>


<ol>
    <li>
        The Father General with the consent of his Council is entrusted with the erection of a
        House to serve as novitiate in accordance with Canon Law (Can 647, §.1). It belongs to his
        competence to transfer or to close a Novitiate (Art. 130, §2). Suitable Monks should be
        assigned to the Order’s Novitiates. All of them, together with the Master, are responsible
        for creating a close unity of spirit and activity as well as a prayerful and family
        atmosphere. They do this, aware of the particular influence which they have on the formation
        of novices.
    </li>
    <li>
        For the validity of the Novitiate it is necessary that it take place in a House designated
        for this purpose. In special cases and by way of exception, the Superior General with the
        consent of his Council may allow a candidate to make his Novitiate in another house under
        the direction of an experienced Monk, who in this case, fulfils the role of Master.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Major Superior may give permission for the Community of Novices to spend a specific
        period of time in another house of the Order designated by him.
    </li>
    <li>
        Absence from the Novitiate during the canonical year which lasts over a period of three
        months, uninterrupted or interrupted, nullifies the Novitiate. An absence of more than
        fifteen days must be made up. With the permission of the Major Superior, <span index="Religious Profession!First">First Profession</span>
        may be anticipated but not by more than fifteen days.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="art71">Article 71</h2>


<ol>
    <li> The Master of Novices who is appointed by a Major Superior with the deciding vote of his
        Council must be a Monk in Solemn Vows. He is directly responsible for the administration of
        the Novitiate and for the Novices’ formation. He should be distinguished by his love for the
        Order and a knowledge of its spirit as well as by Evangelical Prudence. He should possess
        the qualities of knowledge as well as a pastoral-educational background.
    </li>

    <li> The Master of Novices may be assigned assistants who are subject to him in matters
        pertaining to the administration and course of formation in the novitiate. Both the Master
        of Novices as well as his assistants should be carefully prepared to take on such
        obligations and must be free of any and all assignments which would impeded their fruitful
        and uninterrupted execution of their responsibilities (Can. 651).
    </li>


</ol>

<h2 id="art72">Article 72</h2>

<p>
    It is the duty of the Master of Novices to assist the Novices in adapting to Religious Life. He
    does this both by his example and by his teachings. It is his duty to educate them in living out
    the Evangelical Counsels. He uses as models both Christ and His Mother – a Mother who is virgin,
    poor and obedient. He leads them also into a deeper love of God and their fellow Brothers
    through a life of prayer and sacrifice. This love extends, likewise, to the Church and its
    shepherds (Can. 652).
</p>
<p>
    It must be his concern to deepen and broaden their knowledge. This is a condition for developing
    their interior life. He should take care then, to educate them in the knowledge of how to read
    and meditate on Holy Scripture, so that they might more consciously experience the Mystery of
    the Church and its Liturgy.
</p>
<p>
    It is his duty to set before them the demands of the Pauline vocation through a study of its
    character, history and tradition.
</p>

<h2 id="art73">Article 73</h2>

<p>
    The novitiate will truly be a time for growth in vocation and will at the same time become for
    the novice a happy beginning of his Monastic Life if he himself makes efforts to cooperate with
    the Grace of God in the work of conversion and through the transformation of himself into a new
    man in Christ. He must take responsibility upon himself for this spiritual work as well as for
    developing a spirit of prayer using as an example St. Paul the First Hermit. He must take care,
    furthermore, to root out his faults and to acquire virtue through mortification and Religious
    Discipline. It is his responsibility to take advantage of all the Graces and spiritual aids with
    which Religious Life abounds. He must take care to be sincere, willing to accept instruction and
    open to acquiring a truly Monastic manner of behaviour. He must be willing to struggle with
    self-growth and to foster the interior life as well as to work for the good and the growth of
    the Pauline Family.
</p>

<h2 id="art74">Article 74</h2>

<ol>
    <li>
        <p>
            The Master of Novices is obliged to inform the Major Superior as to the development of
            the Novices’ vocation. Thus, the Major Superior will be able to decide at the proper
            time whether the Novice should be admitted to vows, refused admission or whether he
            should be dismissed.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the end of the Novitiate, he must also send to the Major Superior the opinion of all
            the professed in Solemn Vows who live in the Novitiate.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        If the Novice decides that he is not called to our Order he is free to leave the
        Novitiate.
    </li>
    <li>
        In the event that the Novice gives serious scandal or is the cause of an evil, which
        threatens the Community, the Master of Novices in agreement with the governing body of the
        house, is able to dismiss the culprit from the Novitiate if it is impossible to have
        recourse to the Major Superior. He must, later inform the Major Superior as to the details
        of the case.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="art75">Article 75</h2>

<p>
    If the Novice is sure of his calling and has decided that he is willing to give himself to the
    loving service of God above all else through the taking of religious vows, having completed
    Novitiate, he should make a written petition for admission to Profession. Immediate preparation
    for the taking of vows consists of a six-day retreat. Profession is made in accordance with the
    requirement of Canon Law and the Order’s law. He should delegate anyone of his choosing to
    administer all his material goods. Such a person is free to use and dispose of the Novice’s
    revenues until the time of his Perpetual Profession. (Can. 668, §. 1)
</p>
<p>
    Novices enjoy all the privileges and Graces granted to the Order. In danger of death they have
    the right to profess vows and to enjoy the suffrage of the same prayers as do the professed.
