    O Lord our God, grant to us, we beseech you,
    by the intercession of blessed Pachomius
    who purified himself in the desert for the sake of the monastical and cenobitical life
    and wrought a holy and bloodless martyrdom,
    that we may be acceptable to you in words and deeds
    and succeed in obtaining the inheritance of the kingdom of heaven.
    Through our Lord Jesus Christ your Son,
    who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
    one God, for ever and ever.
</litany>
