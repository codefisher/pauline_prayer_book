<h2><span class="rubric">Memorial</span></h2>

<p><em>
    Pachomius was an Egyptian Monk, the writer of the first rule of religious life and of
    coenobitism. He was born around 287AD in Egypt. In his youth he was recruited into the Roman
    Army. During his service, under the influence of the selfless help of Christians, he converted
    to the faith. He resolved to give himself to the exclusive service of God. He went into the
    Desert, where he lived in austere asceticism under the guidance of St Palemon, following which
    he lived a life of solitude in Tabenna, where he himself founded a monastic community.

<litany>
    O Lord our God, grant to us, we beseech you,
    by the intercession of blessed Pachomius
    who purified himself in the desert for the sake of the monastical and cenobitical life
    and wrought a holy and bloodless martyrdom,
    that we may be acceptable to you in words and deeds
    and succeed in obtaining the inheritance of the kingdom of heaven.
    Through our Lord Jesus Christ your Son,
    who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
    one God, for ever and ever.
</litany>
