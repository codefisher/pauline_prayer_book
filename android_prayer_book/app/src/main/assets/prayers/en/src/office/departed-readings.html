<psalm>
    Remember those, O Lord,
    Who in your peace have died,
    Yet may not gain love's high reward
    Till love is purified!

    With you they faced death's night,
    Sealed with your victory sign,
    Soon may the splendour of your light
    On them for ever shine!

    Sweet is their pain, yet deep,
    Till perfect love is born;
    Their lone night-watch they gladly keep
    Before your radiant morn!

    Your love is their great joy;
    Your will their one desire;
    As finest gold without alloy
    Refine them in love's fire!

    For them we humbly pray;
    Perfect them in your love!
    O may we share eternal day
    With them in heaven above.

<reading label="First Reading" ref="15:35-57"
         tagline="The resurrection of the dead and the coming of the Lord">A reading from the first letter of St. Paul to the Corinthians
</reading>

<p>
    Someone may ask, ‘How are dead people raised, and what sort of body do they have when they come back?’ They are stupid questions. Whatever you sow in the ground has to die before it is given new life and the thing that you sow is not what is going to come; you sow a bare grain, say of wheat or something like that, and then God gives it the sort of body that he has chosen: each sort of seed gets its own sort of body.
</p>
<p>
    Everything that is flesh is not the same flesh: there is human flesh, animals’ flesh, the flesh of birds and the flesh of fish. Then there are heavenly bodies and there are earthly bodies; but the heavenly bodies have a beauty of their own and the earthly bodies a different one. The sun has its brightness, the moon a different brightness, and the stars a different brightness, and the stars differ from each other in brightness. It is the same with the resurrection of the dead: the thing that is sown is perishable but what is raised is imperishable; the thing that is sown is contemptible but what is raised is glorious; the thing that is sown is weak but what is raised is powerful; when it is sown it embodies the soul, when it is raised it embodies the spirit.
</p>
<p>
    If the soul has its own embodiment, so does the spirit have its own embodiment. The first man, Adam, as scripture says, became a living soul; but the last Adam has become a life-giving spirit. That is, first the one with the soul, not the spirit, and after that, the one with the spirit. The first man, being from the earth, is earthly by nature; the second man is from heaven. As this earthly man was, so are we on earth; and as the heavenly man is, so are we in heaven. And we, who have been modelled on the earthly man, will be modelled on the heavenly man.
</p>
<p>
    Or else, brothers, put it this way: flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God: and the perishable cannot inherit what lasts for ever. I will tell you something that has been secret: that we are not all going to die, but we shall all be changed. This will be instantaneous, in the twinkling of an eye, when the last trumpet sounds. It will sound, and the dead will be raised, imperishable, and we shall be changed as well, because our present perishable nature must put on imperishability and this mortal nature must put on immortality.
</p>
<p>
    When this perishable nature has put on imperishability, and when this mortal nature has put on immortality, then the words of scripture will come true: Death is swallowed up in victory. Death, where is your victory? Death, where is your sting? Now the sting of death is sin, and sin gets its power from the Law. So let us thank God for giving us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

<reading label="Second Reading" longref="(Dives in Misericordia, n. 8)"
         tagline="Love More Powerful Than Death, More Powerful Than Sin">
    A reading from the Encyclical Letter <em>Dives in Misericordia</em> by St. John Paul II, pope
</reading>

<p>
    The cross of Christ on Calvary is also a witness to the strength of evil against the very Son of
    God.
</p>

<p>
    And here, precisely in Him, in Christ, justice is done to sin at the price of His sacrifice, of
    His obedience &ldquo;even to death&rdquo; (Phil. 2:8). He who was without sin, &ldquo;God made him sin for our
    sake&rdquo; (2 Cor. 5:21).
    Justice is also brought to bear upon death, which from the beginning of man&rsquo;s history had been
    allied to sin. Death has justice done to it at the price of the death of the one who was without
    sin and who alone was able&mdash;by means of his own death&mdash;to inflict death upon death (cf. 1 Cor
    15:54). In this way
    the cross of Christ, on which the Son, consubstantial with the Father, renders full justice to
    God, is also a radical revelation of mercy, or rather of the love that goes against what
    constitutes the very root of evil in the history of man: against sin and death.
</p>

<p>
    In the paschal mystery the limits of the many sided evil in which man becomes a sharer during
    his earthly existence are surpassed: the cross of Christ, in fact, makes us understand the
    deepest roots of evil, which are fixed in sin and death; thus the cross becomes an
    eschatological sign. Only in the eschatological fulfillment and definitive renewal of the world
    will love conquer, in all the elect, the deepest sources of evil, bringing as its fully mature
    fruit the kingdom of life and holiness and glorious immortality.
</p>

<p>
    Until &ldquo;the former things pass away&rdquo; (Rev. 21:4), the cross will remain the point of reference for other
    words too of the Revelation of John: &ldquo;Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears my
    voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with him and he with me&rdquo; (Rev. 3:20). In a special way,
    God also reveals His mercy when He invites man to have &ldquo;mercy&rdquo; on His only Son, the crucified
    one.
</p>

<p>
    In fact, Christ, whom the Father &ldquo;did not spare&rdquo; (Rom. 8:32) for the sake of man and who in His passion
    and in the torment of the cross did not obtain human mercy, has revealed in His resurrection the
    fullness of the love that the Father has for Him and, in Him, for all people. &ldquo;He is not God of
    the dead, but of the living&rdquo; (Mk 12:27). In His resurrection Christ has revealed the God of merciful
    love, precisely because He accepted the cross as the way to the resurrection.
</p>

<p>
    Here is the Son of God, who in His resurrection experienced in a radical way mercy shown to
    Himself, that is to say the love of the Father which is more powerful than death. And it is also
    the same Christ, the Son of God, who at the end of His messianic mission &mdash; and, in a certain
    sense, even beyond the end &mdash; reveals Himself as the inexhaustible source of mercy, of the same
    love that, in a subsequent perspective of the history of salvation in the Church, is to be
    everlastingly confirmed as more powerful than sin. The paschal Christ is the definitive
    incarnation of mercy, its living sign in salvation history and in eschatology. In the same
    spirit, the liturgy of Eastertide places on our lips the words of the Psalm: Misericordias
    Domini in aeternum cantabo. (Ps 89 [88]:2)

    O God, glory of the faithful and life of the just,
    by the Death and Resurrection of whose Son
    we have been redeemed,
    look mercifully on your departed servants,
    the brothers, relatives and benefactors of our Order,
    that, just as they professed the mystery of our resurrection,
    so they may merit to receive the joys of eternal happiness.
    Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
    who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
    one God, for ever and ever.
