<h1>Contemplation of God in His Saints</h1>

<p class="instruction">
    The Second Vatican Council reminds us that in honouring
the saints, the Church proclaims the paschal mystery. The Church
presents their exemplary lives that steer us on our way to the Eter-
nal Father and allow us to participate in their abundant merits (cf
SL 104). In our Constitutions we read the following: “We are led
to do this through the example of St. Paul the First Hermit in his
communing one-on-one with God...We are further encouraged by
the tradition of our Fathers, but above all, through the example of
the praying Christ and his Mother. It is in prayer that we are able
to recognize the plan of God for us and for the world” (art. 26).
