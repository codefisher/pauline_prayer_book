<h2>3.1 Act of dedication to St. Michael the Archangel</h2>

    <p>
        St. Michael the Archangel, the greatest Prince of heaven,
        the most faithful Guardian of the Church, behold, I am most un-
        worthy to see your face, but full of confidence in your goodness,
        encouraged by the power of your prayers and numerous benefits, I
        stand before you in the company of my Guardian angel and in the
        presence of all Angels of heaven whom I take as witnesses of my
        devotion towards you.
    </p>

    <p>
        I choose you this day for my special defender and protec-
        tor. I firmly resolve to honour you always and to promote devotion
        to you. Be at my side always that I may never offend God, either
        by thought, word or deed. Defend me against the temptations of
        the devil, particularly directed against faith and purity and at the
        hour of my death, pray for me and lead me to the Eternal Home.
        Amen.
    </p>

    <h2>3.2 Prayer to St. Michael the Archangel for the Church and the
        Holy Father
    </h2>

    <p>
        St. Michael the Archangel, Patron of the Universal Church
        and a special Protector of the Holy See! We pray to you with
        lively faith and trust that you may defend and watch over the Holy
        Spouse of Christ, the Church. Show yourself now a great Guardian
        of the Church in this time of godlessness. Protect the Vicar of
        Christ on earth. Inspire the faithful with great honour due to the
        Vicar of Christ. May they respect and obey him with love as a
        Father of all the children of God. O Prince and Guardian of God’s
        Holy People!
    </p>

    <p>
        Pray that the Church may grow in numbers and in holiness.
        Inspire young people to become apostles and defenders of God’s
        Holy Laws. Never allow hatred to triumph. With your victorious
        sword, defend the See of St. Peter. Come in haste to his defence in
        every need. Join together all the hearts of all the faithful with the
        Centre of the Catholic world. Amen.
    </p>

    <h2>3.3 Prayer to St. Michael the Archangel</h2>

    <p>
        Saint Michael Archangel,
        defend us in battle,
        be our safeguard against the wickedness and snares of the devil;
        may God rebuke him, we humbly pray;
        and do thou, O Prince of the heavenly host,
        by the power of God, cast into hell
        Satan and all the other evil spirits
        who wander through the world for the ruin of souls.
        Amen
    </p>
