            We thank you, Father,
            for the holy vine of David, your servant,
            which you have made known to us

            was scattered upon the mountains,
            was gathered up again, to become one,
            so may your Church be gathered together
            from the ends of the earth into your Kingdom,
            for yours is the glory and the power

    <h2>5.2 Prayer of St. Thomas Aquinas</h2>

    <p>
        I give you thanks,
        Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God,
        who have been pleased to nourish me,
        a sinner and your unworthy servant,
        with the precious Body and Blood
        of your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ:
        this through no merits of mine,
        but due solely to the graciousness of your mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
        And I pray that this Holy Communion
        may not be for me an offense to be punished,
        but a saving plea for forgiveness.
        May it be for me the armor of faith,
        and the shield of good will.
        May it cancel my faults,
        destroy concupiscence and carnal passion,
        increase charity and patience, humility and obedience
        and all the virtues,
        may it be a firm defense against the snares of all my
        enemies,
        both visible and invisible,
        the complete calming of my impulses,
        both of the flesh and of the spirit,
        a firm adherence to you, the one true God,
        and the joyful completion of my lifeâ€™s course.
    </p>
    <p>
        And I beseech you to lead me, a sinner,
        to that banquet beyond all telling,
        where with your Son and the Holy Spirit
        you are the true light of your Saints,
        fullness of satisfied desire, eternal gladness,
        consummate delight and perfect happiness.
        Through Christ our Lord.
        Amen.
    </p>

    <h2>5.4 Prayer of self-offering to Jesus Christ</h2>

    <p>
        Receive, Lord, my entire freedom.
        Accept the whole of my memory,
        my intellect and my will.
        Whatever I have or possess,
        it was you who gave it to me;
        I restore it to you in full,
        and I surrender it completely
        to the guidance of your will.
        Give me only love of you
        together with your grace,
        and I am rich enough
        and ask for nothing more.
        Amen.
    </p>

    <h2>5.5 The Universal Prayer
        <span>(attributed to Pope Clement XI)</span>
    </h2>

    <p>
        I believe, O Lord, but may I believe more firmly;
        I hope, but may I hope more securely;
        I love, but may I love more ardently;
        I sorrow, but may I sorrow more deeply.
        I adore you as my first beginning;
        I long for you as my last end;
        I praise you as my constant benefactor;
        I invoke you as my gracious protector.
    </p>
    <p>
        By your wisdom direct me,
        by your righteousness restrain me,
        by your indulgence console me,
        by your power protect me.
    </p>
    <p>
        I offer you, Lord, my thoughts to be directed to you,
        my words, to be about you,
        my deeds, to respect your will,
        my trials, to be endured for you.
    </p>
    <p>
        I will whatever you will,
        I will it because you will it,
        I will it in the way you will it,
        I will it for as long as you will it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lord, enlighten my understanding, I pray:
        arouse my will,
        cleanse my heart,
        sanctify my soul.
    </p>
    <p>
        May I weep for past sins,
        repel future temptations,
        correct evil inclinations,
        nurture appropriate virtues.
    </p>
    <p>
        Give me, good God,
        love for you, hatred for myself,
        zeal for my neighbor,
        contempt for the world.
    </p>
    <p>
        May I strive to obey superiors,
        to help those dependent on me,
        to have care for my friends,
        forgiveness for my enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
        May I conquer sensuality by austerity,
        avarice by generosity,
        anger by gentleness,
        lukewarmness by fervor.
    </p>
    <p>
        Render me prudent in planning,
        steadfast in dangers,
        patient in adversity,
        humble in prosperity.
    </p>
    <p>
        Make me, O Lord, attentive at prayer,
        moderate at meals,
        diligent in work,
        steadfast in intent.
    </p>
    <p>
        May I be careful to maintain interior innocence,
        outward modesty,
        exemplary behavior,
        a regular life.
    </p>
    <p>
        May I be always watchful in subduing nature,
        in nourishing grace,
        in observing your law,
        in winning salvation.
    </p>
    <p>
        May I learn from you
        how precarious are earthly things,
        how great divine things,
        how fleeting is time,
        how lasting things eternal.
    </p>
    <p>
        Grant that I may prepare for death,
        fear judgment,
        flee hell,
        gain paradise.
        Through Christ our Lord.
        Amen.
    </p>

    <h2>5.6 Prayer to our Lady</h2>

    <p>
        O Mary, Virgin and Mother most holy,
        behold, I have received your most dear Son,
        whom you conceived in your immaculate womb,
        brought forth, nursed and embraced most tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
        Behold him at whose sight
        you used to rejoice and be filled with all delight;
        him whom, humbly and lovingly,
        once again I present
        and offer him to you
        to be clasped in your arms,
        to be loved by your heart,
        and to be offered up to the Most Holy Trinity
        as the supreme worship of adoration,
        for your own honor and glory
        and for my needs and for those of the whole world.
    </p>
    <p>
        I ask you therefore, most loving Mother:
        entreat for me the forgiveness of all my sins
        and, in abundant measure, the grace
        of serving him in the future more faithfully,
        and at the last, final grace,
        so that with you I may praise him
        for all the ages of ages.
        Amen.
    </p>

    <h2>5.7 An Act of Worship</h2>

    <p>
        I adore you Jesus, truly present in my heart, born of the
        Virgin Mary, the only-begotten Son and the glory of the Father. I
        thank you my Redeemer that you deigned to come to me, a miser-
        able and poor sinner.
    </p>

    <p>
        Together with Mary, I offer you to your Father, and with
        you and through you, may eternal glory, thanksgiving and prayer
        for world peace go up before his heavenly throne. Illumine my
        mind and heart that I may renew within myself the desire to belong
        to you alone. For you live for ever and ever. Amen.
