        We thank you, Father,
        For the holy vine of David, your servant,
        Which you have made known to us

        In the same way that this bread which is now broken
        was scattered upon the mountains,
        was gathered up again, to become one,
        so may your Church be gathered together
        from the ends of the earth into the kingdom,
        for yours is the glory and the power
        through Jesus Christ for ever.

        We thank you, Holy Father, for your holy name,

        May your grace come down and may this world pass away.
        Hosanna to God of David!
        Who is a saint, let him approach!
        Who is not, let him repent!
        Come, Lord Jesus! Amen.

<h2>5.2 Prayer of St. Thomas Aquinas</h2>

<p>
    I thank you, holy Lord, almighty Father, eternal God, who
    deigned to nourish me, your sinful and unworthy servant, with the
    precious Body and Blood of your Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, not
    for any merit of mine, but only because of your merciful goodness.
</p>

<p>
    And I pray that this holy communion, far from condemn-
    ing me to punishment, may bring about my pardon and salvation,
    encompassing me with the armour of faith and the shield of a good
    will. By it let my vices be done away with, all lustful desires extin-
    guished. May it advance me in charity, patience, humility, obedi-
    ence, and every other virtue.
</p>

<p>
    Let it be a strong defence against the wiles of all my ene-
    mies, visible and invisible, allaying for me every disturbance of
    flesh and spirit, binding me firmly to you, the one true God, and
    bringing my last hour to a happy close.
</p>

<p>
    I pray, too, that it may be your pleasure to call my sinful
    self one day to that banquet, wonderful past all telling, where you,
    with your Son and the Holy Spirit, nourish your saints with the
    vision of yourself, who are the true light, the fulfilment of all de-
    sires, the joy that knows no ending, gladness unalloyed, and perfect
    bliss: through the same Christ our Lord. Amen.
</p>

<h2>5.3 Petitions to our Holy Redeemer</h2>

    <prayer lines="lines">
        Soul of Christ, be my sanctification;
        Body of Christ, be my salvation;
        Blood of Christ, fill all my veins;
        Water of Christ’s side, wash out my stains;
    </prayer>

    <prayer lines="lines">
        Passion of Christ, my comfort be;
        O good Jesu, listen to me;
        In thy wounds I fain would hide,
        Ne’er to be parted from thy side;
    </prayer>
</div>

<div class="prayer-group">
    <prayer lines="lines">
        Guard me, should the foe assail me;
        Call me when my life shall fail me;
        Bid me come to thee above,
        With thy saints to sing thy love,
        World without end. Amen.

<h2>5.4 Prayer of self-dedication to Jesus Christ</h2>

<p>
    Take all my freedom, Lord; accept the whole of my mem-
    ory, understanding, and will. Whatever I have or hold comes to me
    from your bounty. I give it all back to you, surrender it all to the
    guidance of your will. Your grace and the love of you are wealth
    enough: give me but that, and I ask for nothing more.
</p>

<h2>5.5 The Universal Prayer
    <span>(attributed to Pope Clement XI)</span>
</h2>

<p>
    Lord, I believe in you; oh, give me a firmer faith. I hope in
    you, give me a surer hope. I love you, make me love you more and
    more. I am sorry to have failed you; make me sorrier yet.
</p>

<p>
    I adore you as my first beginning, and long for you
    as my last end; I praise you as my constant benefactor, and call
    upon you as my gracious protector:
</p>

<p>
    Guide me by your wisdom, restrain me by your jus-
    tice, comfort me by your mercy, defend me by your power.
</p>

<p>
    I offer you, Lord, my thoughts, to be fixed on you;
    my words, to have you for their theme; my actions, to be done ac-
    cording to your will; my hardships, to be endured for your sake.
</p>

<p>
    My will is that your will be done, in the manner you
    will, and as long as you will, because it is your will.
</p>

<p>
    I pray you, Lord, enlighten my understanding, in-
    flame my will, purify my heart, and sanctify my soul.
</p>

<p>
    Help me to deplore my past offences and to resist
    temptation in future, to subdue my evil inclinations and to cultivate
    the virtues proper for my state. God of all goodness, fill me with
    love of you and hatred of myself, with zeal for my neighbour and
    contempt of worldly things.
</p>

<p>
    Teach me to be obedient to my superiors, helpful to
    my subordinates, faithful to friends, forgiving to foes.
</p>

<p>
    Let me vanquish pleasure by self-denial, avarice by
    generosity, anger by meekness, and lukewarmness by fervour.
</p>

<p>
    Make me prudent in planning, courageous in taking
    risks; in affliction, patient; in prosperity, unassuming.
</p>

<p>
    ction, patient; in prosperity, unassuming.
    Lord, make me attentive at prayers, moderate when I
    eat and drink, diligent in my occupation, and constant in good reso-
    lutions.
</p>

<p>
    Let my conscience be clear, my demeanour modest,
    my talk blameless, my life well-ordered. Let me always be alert to
    keep nature in check, to cherish your grace, to keep your law, and
    to act in a manner befitting salvation.
</p>

<p>
    Teach me how petty this world is, how immense
    your heaven; how short the time, and infinite is eternity. Give me
    grace to prepare for death, to dread your judgment, to escape hell,
    and to win a place in heaven: through Christ our Lord. Amen.
</p>

<h2>5.6 Prayer to our Lady</h2>

<p>
    O Mary, most holy Virgin-Mother, I have received your
    well-beloved Son, whom you conceived in your stainless womb,
    brought forth and suckled, and enfolded in your sweet embraces.
    See, humbly and lovingly I give back to you the Son whom it was
    all rapture and delight for you to look upon; I offer him to be
    clasped in your arms, to be loved with all your heart, and to be of-
    fered up to the Holy Trinity in the supreme homage of adoration,
    for your honour and glory, and for my needs and those of all man-
    kind.
</p>

<p>
    Most loving Mother, I beg you to obtain for me forgive-
    ness of all my sins, grace in abundance to serve him more faithfully
    from now onwards, and lastly, final perseverance, so that I may
    praise him with you for ever and ever. Amen.
</p>

<h2>5.7 An Act of Worship</h2>

<p>
    I adore you Jesus, truly present in my heart, born of the
    Virgin Mary, the only-begotten Son and the glory of the Father. I
    thank you my Redeemer that you deigned to come to me, a miser-
    able and poor sinner.
</p>

<p>
    Together with Mary, I offer you to your Father, and with
    you and through you, may eternal glory, thanksgiving and prayer
    for world peace go up before his heavenly throne. Illumine my
    mind and heart that I may renew within myself the desire to belong
    to you alone. For you live for ever and ever. Amen.
