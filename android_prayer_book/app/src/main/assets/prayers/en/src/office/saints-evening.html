<psalm>
    To Thy poor servants reconciled
    show mercy, Christ, for whom the mild
    and Virgin Patroness this grace
    implore before Thy Father's face.

    Ye purpled martyrs, you, now dressed
    in white because your lives confessed
    your Lord on earth, us exiles call
    unto the fatherland of all.

    O choir of virgins, stainless band!
    and ye for whom the desert-land
    made sure the way to heavenly rest,
    prepare us mansions with the blest.

    The race perfidious expel
    from regions where the faithful dwell;
    let one sole shepherd be our guide,
    all Christians in one fold abide.

    Glory, O Father! to Thy name;
    eternal Son, to Thine the same;
    to Holy Paraclete be praise
    throughout the everlasting days.

<p class="ref">Psalm 109(110):1-5, 7</p>
<psalm>
    The Lord’s revelation to my Master: +
    - ‘Sit on my right: *
    - your foes I will put beneath your feet.’

    The Lord will wield from Zion +
    - your sceptre of power: *
    - rule in the midst of all your foes.

    A prince from the day of your birth +
    - on the holy mountains; *
    - from the womb before the dawn I begot you.

    The Lord has sworn an oath he will not change. +
    - ‘You are a priest for ever, *
    - a priest like Melchizedek of old.’

    The Master standing at your right hand *
    - will shatter kings in the day of his wrath.

    He shall drink from the stream by the wayside *
    - and therefore he shall lift up his head.

<p class="ref">Psalm 115 (116)</p>
<psalm>
    I trusted, even when I said: *
    - ‘I am sorely afflicted,’
    and when I said in my alarm: *
    - ‘No man can be trusted.’

    How can I repay the Lord *
    - for his goodness to me?
    The cup of salvation I will raise; *
    - I will call on the Lord’s name.

    My vows to the Lord I will fulfil *
    - before all his people.
    O precious in the eyes of the Lord *
    - is the death of his faithful.

    Your servant, Lord, your servant am I; *
    - you have loosened my bonds.
    A thanksgiving sacrifice I make; *
    - I will call on the Lord’s name.

    My vows to the Lord I will fulfil *
    - before all his people,
    in the courts of the house of the Lord, *
    - in your midst, O Jerusalem.

<psalm>
    Worthy are you, our Lord and God, *
    - to receive glory and honour and power,
    for you created all things, *
    - and by your will they existed and were created.

    Worthy are you, O Lord, *
    - to take the scroll and open its seals,
    for you were slain, +
    - and by your blood you ransomed men for God *
    - from every tribe and tongue and people and nation.

    You have made us a kingdom and priests to our God, *
    - and we shall reign on earth.

    Worthy is the Lamb who was slain *
    - to receive power and wealth
    and wisdom and might *
    - and honour and glory and blessing.

<p>
    There are a few in Sardis, it is true, who have kept their robes from being dirtied, and they are fit to come with me, dressed in white.  Those who prove victorious will be dressed, like these, in white robes; I shall not blog their names out of the book of life, but will acknowledge their names i the presence of my Father and his angels.

<psalm>
    My soul glorifies the Lord, *
    - my spirit rejoices in God, my Saviour.
    He looks on his servant in her lowliness; *
    - henceforth all ages will call me blessed.

    The Almighty works marvels for me. *
    - Holy his name!
    His mercy is from age to age, *
    - on those who fear him.

    He puts forth his arm in strength *
    - and scatters the proud hearted.
    He casts the mighty from their thrones *
    - and raises the lowly.

    He fills the starving with good things, *
    - send the rich away empty.

    He protects Israel, his servant, *
    - remembering his mercy,
    the mercy promised to our fathers, *
    - to Abraham and his sons forever.
