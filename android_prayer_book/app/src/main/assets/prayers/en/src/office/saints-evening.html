<psalm>
    To Thy poor servants reconciled
    show mercy, Christ, for whom the mild
    and Virgin Patroness this grace
    implore before Thy Father's face.

    Ye purpled martyrs, you, now dressed
    in white because your lives confessed
    your Lord on earth, us exiles call
    unto the fatherland of all.

    O choir of virgins, stainless band!
    and ye for whom the desert-land
    made sure the way to heavenly rest,
    prepare us mansions with the blest.

    The race perfidious expel
    from regions where the faithful dwell;
    let one sole shepherd be our guide,
    all Christians in one fold abide.

    Glory, O Father! to Thy name;
    eternal Son, to Thine the same;
    to Holy Paraclete be praise
    throughout the everlasting days.

<psalm>
    The Lórd’s revelátion to my Máster: +
    - ‘Sít on my ríght: *
    - your fóes I will pút beneath your féet.’

    The Lórd will wíeld from Síon +
    - your scéptre of pówer: *
    - rúle in the mídst of all your fóes.

    A prínce from the dáy of your bírth +
    - on the hóly móuntains; *
    - from the wómb before the dáwn I begót you.

    The Lórd has sworn an óath he will not chánge. +
    - ‘You are a príest for éver, *
    - a príest like Melchízedek of óld.’

    The Máster stánding at your ríght hand *
    - will shatter kíngs in the dáy of his wráth.

    He shall drínk from the stréam by the wáyside *
    - and thérefore he shall líft up his héad.

    Worthy are you, our Lord and God, *

<p>
    There are a few in Sardis, it is true, who have kept their robes from being dirtied, and they
    are fit to come with me, dressed in white. Those who prove victorious will be dressed, like
    these, in white robes; I shall not blot their names out of the book of life, but will
    acknowledge their names in the presence of my Father and his angels.

    My soul glórifies the Lórd, *

    His mércy is from age to áge, *

    He casts the míghty from their thrónes *

    He fills the stárving with good thíngs, *

<litany>
    Almighty ever-living God,
    who ever adorn, protect and keep your Church
    with the various splendours of the Saints,
    graciously grant that,
    by the prayers of Blessed Paul the First Hermit
    and his holy sons and daughters,
    the merits of all of whom you have granted us to honour on one feast day,
    both that we may be purified from every fault here,
    and that we may fully enjoy eternal glory in the future.
    Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
    who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
    one God, for ever and ever.
