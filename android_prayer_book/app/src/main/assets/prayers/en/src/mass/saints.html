<h2><span class="rubric">Memorial</span></h2>

<h2 class="rubric">Entrance Antiphon</h2>

<litany>
    Let us all rejoice in the Lord celebrating the feast day
    in honour of all the Saints of the Pauline Order,
    at whose festival the Angels rejoice
    and praise the Son of God.
</litany>

<h2 class="rubric">Collect</h2>
<litany>
    Almighty ever-living God,
    who ever adorn, protect and keep your Church
    with the various splendours of the Saints,
    graciously grant that,
    by the prayers of Blessed Paul the First Hermit
    and his holy sons and daughters,
    the merits of all of whom you have granted us to honour on one feast day,
    both that we may be purified from every fault here,
    and that we may fully enjoy eternal glory in the future.
    Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
    who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
    one God, for ever and ever.
</litany>

<h2 class="rubric">Prayer over the Offerings</h2>
<litany>
    O Lord, attend to our prayers,
    which we offer in memory of all the Saints of our Order of the First Hermit,
    so that we who have no confidence in our righteousness
    may be helped by the merits of those who have pleased you.
    Through Christ our Lord.
</litany>

<h2 class="rubric">Communion Antiphon <span class="ref">Mt 5:8-10</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">
    Blessed are the clean of heart, for they shall see God.
    Blessed are the peacemakers,
    for they shall be called children of God.
    Blessed are they who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness,
    for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.
</p>

<h2 class="rubric">Prayer after Communion</h2>
<litany>
    Lord God, we have received heavenly mysteries
    celebrating the memorial of all the saints of our order;
    grant we beseech you that what we endure in time
    might be followed by eternal joys.
    Through Christ our Lord.
</litany>
