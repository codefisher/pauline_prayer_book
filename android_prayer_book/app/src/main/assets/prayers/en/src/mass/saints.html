<h2 class="rubric">Entrance Antiphon</h2>

<litany>
    Let us all rejoice in the Lord celebrating the feast day
    in honour of all the Saints of the Pauline Order,
    about whose solemnity the Angels rejoice and together praise the Son of God.
</litany>

<h2 class="rubric">Collect</h2>
<litany>
    Almighty ever-living God,
    who ever adorn, protect and keep your Church with the different splendours of the saints,
    graciously grant that by the prayers of blessed Paul the First Hermit and his holy sons,
    the merits of all of whom you have granted us to honour on one feast day,
    both that we may be purified from every fault
    and that we may fully enjoy eternal glory in the future.
    who lives and reigns with You in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
    one God for ever and ever.
</litany>

<h2 class="rubric">Prayer over the Offerings</h2>
<litany>
    O Lord, receive our gifts,
    which we offer in memory of all the Saints of our Order,
    that we who do not have the faith of our righteousness
    may be helped by the merits of those who have pleased you.
    Through Christ our Lord.
</litany>

<p class="noindent">
    Blessed are the clean of heart, for they shall see God.
    Blessed are the peacemakers,

    Blessed are they who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness,
    for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.

    Lord God, we have received heavenly mysteries

    grant we beseech you that what we endure in time
    we may obtain with eternal joys.
    Through Christ our Lord.
</litany>
