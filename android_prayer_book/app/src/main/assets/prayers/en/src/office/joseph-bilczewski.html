<p>
    Blessed Archbishop Joseph Bilczewski was born April 26, 1860 in Wilamowice near Kęty, inthe
    present day Diocese of Bielsko Żywiec, then part of the Diocese of Krakow. Having finished
    elementary school at Wilamowic and Kęty, he attended high school at Wadowice receiving his
    diploma in 1880. On July 6, 1884 he was ordained a priest in Krakow by Cardinal Albino
    Dunajewski. In 1886 he received a Doctorate in Theology from the University of Vienna. Following
    advanced studies in Rome and Paris he passed the qualifying exam at the Jaghellonic University
    of Krakow. The following year he became professor of Dogmatic Theology at the John Casimir
    University of Leopoli. He also served as Dean of Theology for a period of time prior to becoming
    Rector of the University. During his tenure at the University, he was appreciated as a professor
    by his students and also enjoyed the friendship and respect of his colleagues. He arduously
    dedicated himself to scientific work and, despite his young age, acquired notoriety as a learned
    man. His extraordinary intellectual and relational abilities were recognized by Francis Joseph,
    the Emperor of Austria, who presented Monsignor Joseph to the Holy Father as a candidate for the
    vacant Metropolitan See of Leopoli. The Holy Father, Leo XIII responded positively to the
    Emperor’s proposal and on December 17, 1900 he named the forty year old Monsignor Joseph
    Bilczewski, Archbishop of Leopoli of the Latin Rite.
</p>
<p>
    Given the complex social, economic, ethnic and religious situation, care for the large diocese
    required of the Bishop a deep commitment and called for great moral effort, strong confidence in
    God, and a faith enlivened by a continual contact with God.
</p>
<p>
    Archbishop Joseph Bilczewski became known for his abundant goodness of heart, understanding,
    humility, piety, commitment to hard work and pastoral zeal which sprung from his immense love
    for God and neighbor.
</p>
<p>
    Upon taking possession of the Archdiocese of Leopoli he spelled out very clearly his pastoral
    plan which can be summed up in the words “totally sacrifice oneself for the Holy Church”. Among
    other things he pointed out the need for the development of devotion to the Most Blessed
    Sacrament and frequent reception of Holy Communion.
</p>
<p>
    A particular form of pastoral action of Archbishop Bilczewski were the pastoral letters and
    appeals addressed to the priests and the faithful of the Archdiocese. In them he spoke of the
    problems of faith and morals of the time as well as of the most pressing issues of the social
    sphere. He also explained devotion to the Eucharist and to the Sacred Heart in them and the
    importance of religious and moral formation of children and youth in the family and in school.
    He taught for the Church and for the Holy Father. Above all, he took great care to cultivate
    many holy priestly vocations. He saw the priest as first and foremost a teacher of faith and an
    instrument of Christ, a father for the rich as well as for the poor. Taking the place of Christ
    on Earth, the priest was to be the minister of the Sacraments and for this reason his whole
    heart had to be dedicated to the celebration of the Eucharist, in order to be able to nourish
    the people of God with the body of Christ.
</p>
<p>
    He often exhorted the priests to adoration of the most Blessed Sacrament. In his pastoral letter
    devoted to the Eucharist he invited the priests to participate in the priestly associations: The
    Association for Perpetual Adoration of the Most Holy Sacrament and the Association of Aid to
    Poor Catholic Churches whose goal was to rejuvenate the zeal of the priests themselves. He also
    dedicated a great deal of care to the preparation of children and to full participation in the
    Mass, desiring that every Catechesis would lead children and youth to the Eucharist. Archbishop
    Joseph Bilczewski promoted the construction of churches and chapels, schools and day-care
    centers. He developed teaching to help enable the growth in the instruction of the faithful. He
    materially and spiritually helped the more important works which were springing up in his
    Archdiocese. His holy life, filled with prayer, work and works of mercy led 18 to his meriting
    great appreciation and respect on the part of those of various faiths, rites and nationalities
    present in the Archdiocese. No religious or nationalistic conflicts arose during the tenure of
    his pastoral work. He was a proponent of unity, harmony and peace. On social issues he always
    stood on the side of the people and of the poor. He taught that the base of social life had to
    be justice made perfect by Christian love. During the First World War, when souls were overtaken
    with hate and a lack of appreciation of the other, he pointed out to the people the infinite
    love of God, capable of forgiving every type of sin and offense. He reminded them of the need to
    observe the commandments of God and particularly that of brotherly love. Sensitive to the social
    questions regarding the family and youth, he courageously proposed solutions to problems based
    on the love of God and of neighbor. During his 23 years of pastoral service he changed the face
    of the Archdiocese of Leopoli. Only his death on the 20th of March 1923 could end his vast and
    far-sighted pastoral action.
</p>
<p>
    He was prepared for death and accepted it with peace and submission as a sign of God’s will,
    which he always considered sacred.

    O God, who to St Joseph, bishop,
    granted apostolic zeal and a devotion to the mystery of the Eucharist,
    grant we beseech you, that by his intercession,
    we may be abundantly fed with the bread of life
    and rejoice with the pledge of eternity.
    Through our Lord Jesus Christ your Son,
    who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
    one God, for ever and ever.
