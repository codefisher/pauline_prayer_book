<p class="noindent">
    Until the spirit is poured out on us from above,<br/>
    and the desert becomes productive ground,<br/>
    so productive you might take it for a forest.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
    Fair judgement will fix its home in the desert,<br/>
    and uprightness live in the productive ground,<br/>
    and the product of uprightness will be peace,<br/>
     the effect of uprightness being quite and security for ever.

<p class="noindent">
    My people will live in a peaceful home, <br/>
    in peaceful houses, tranquil dwellings.

</reading>

<p>
    There is a variety of gifts but always the same Spirit; there are all sorts of service to be
    done, but always to the same Lord; working in all sorts of different ways in different people,
    it is the same God who is working in all of them. The particular way in which the Spirit is
    given to each person is for a good purpose. One may have the gift of preaching with wisdom given
    him by the Spirit; another may have the gift of preaching instruction given him by the same
    Spirit; and another the gift of faith given by the same Spirit; another again the gift of
    healing, through this one Spirit; one, the power of miracles; another, prophecy; another the
    gift of recognising spirits; another the gift of tongues and another the ability to interpret
    them. All these are the work of one and the same Spirit, who distributes different gifts to
    different people just as he chooses.

</reading>

<p>
    Do not let your love be a pretence, but sincerely prefer good to evil. Love each other as much
    as brothers should, and have a profound respect for each other. Work for the Lord with untiring
    effort and with great earnestness of spirit. If you have hope, this will make you cheerful. Do
    not give up if trials come; and keep on praying. If any of the saints are in need you must share
    with them; and you should make hospitality your special care.

    the holy Gospel according to Matthew
</reading>

<p>
    Seeing the crowds, Jesus went up the hill. There he sat down and was joined by his disciples.
    Then he began to speak. This is what he taught them:
</p>
<div class="prayer-group">
    <psalm>
        ‘How happy are the poor in spirit;
        -theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
        Happy the gentle:
        -they shall have the earth for their heritage.
        Happy those who mourn:
        -they shall be comforted.
        Happy those who hunger and thirst for what is right:
        -they shall be satisfied.
        Happy the merciful:
        -they shall have mercy shown them.
        Happy the pure in heart:
        -they shall see God.
        Happy the peacemakers:
        -they shall be called sons of God.
        Happy those who are persecuted in the cause of right:
        -theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
    </psalm>
</div>

    ‘Happy are you when people abuse you and persecute you and speak all kinds of calumny against
    you on my account. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward will be great in heaven: this is how
    they persecuted the prophets before you.’

<reading label="Gospel" ref="12:22-32">A reading from
    the holy Gospel according to Luke
</reading>

<p>
    Jesus said to his disciples, ‘That is why I am telling you not to worry about your life and what
    you are to eat, nor about your body and how you are to clothe it. For life means more than food,
    and the body more than clothing. Think of the ravens. They do not sow or reap; they have no
    storehouses or barns; yet God feeds them. And how much more are you worth than the birds! Can
    any of you, for all his worrying, add a single cubit to his span of life? If the smallest
    things, therefore, are outside your control, why worry about the rest? Think of the flowers;
    they never have to spin or weave; yet, I assure you, not even Solomon in all his regalia was
    robed like one of these. Now if that is how God clothes the grass in the field which is there
    today and thrown into the furnace tomorrow, how much more will he look after you, you men of
    little faith! But you, you must not set your hearts on things to eat and things to drink; nor
    must you worry. It is the pagans of this world who set their hearts on these things. Your Father
    well knows you need them. No; set your hearts on his kingdom, and these other things will be
    given to you as well. ‘There is no need to be afraid, little flock, for it has pleased your
    Father to give you the kingdom.’
