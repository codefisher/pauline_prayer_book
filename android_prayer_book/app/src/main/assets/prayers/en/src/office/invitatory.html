<psalm>
    Come, ring out our joy to the Lord;
    - hail the God who saves us.
    Let us come before him, giving thanks,
    - with songs let us hail the Lord. <sp>R/</sp>

    A mighty God is the Lord,
    - a great king above all gods.
    In his hand are the depths of the earth;
    - the heights of the mountains are his.
    To him belongs the sea, for he made it
    - and the dry land shaped by his hands. <sp>R/</sp>

    Come in; let us bow and bend low;
    - let us kneel before the God who made us:
    for he is our God and we
    - the people who belong to his pasture,
    - the flock that is led by his hand. <sp>R/</sp>

    O that today you would listen to his voice!
    - &lsquo;Harden not your hearts as at Meribah,
    - as on that day at Massah in the desert
    when your fathers put me to the test;
    - when they tried me, though they saw my work. <sp>R/</sp>

    For forty years I was wearied of these people
    - and I said: &ldquo;Their hearts are astray,
    - these people do not know my ways.&rdquo;
    Then I took an oath in my anger:
    - &ldquo;Never shall they enter my rest.&rdquo; &rsquo; <sp>R/</sp>

    Cry out with joy to the Lord, all the earth. +
    - Serve the Lord with gladness. *
    - Come before him, singing for joy.

    Know that he, the Lord, is God. +
    - He made us, we belong to him, *
    - we are his people, the sheep of his flock.

    Go within his gates, giving thanks. +
    - Enter his courts with songs of praise. *
    - Give thanks to him and bless his name.

    Indeed, how good is the Lord, +
    - eternal his merciful love. *

<psalm>
    O God, be gracious and bless us *
    - and let your face shed its light upon us.
    So will your ways be known upon earth *
    - and all nations learn your saving help.

    Let the peoples praise you, O God; *
    - let all the peoples praise you.

    Let the nations be glad and exult *
    - for you rule the world with justice.
    With fairness you rule the peoples, *
    - you guide the nations on earth.

    Let the peoples praise you, O God; *
    - let all the peoples praise you.

    The earth has yielded its fruit *
    - for God, our God, has blessed us.
    May God still give us his blessing *
    - till the ends of the earth revere him.

    Let the peoples praise you, O God; *
    - let all the peoples praise you.

<reading longref="Psalm 23 (24)"></reading>

<psalm>
    The Lordâ€™s is the earth and its fullness, *
    - the world and all its peoples.
    It is he who set it on the seas; *
    - on the waters he made it firm.

    Who shall climb the mountain of the Lord? *
    - Who shall stand in his holy place?
    The man with clean hands and pure heart, +
    - who desires not worthless things, *
    - who has not sworn so as to deceive his neighbour.

    He shall receive blessings from the Lord *
    - and reward from the God who saves him.
    Such are the men who seek him, *
    - seek the face of the God of Jacob.

    O gates, lift high your heads; +
    - grow higher, ancient doors. *
    - Let him enter, the king of glory!

    Who is the king of glory? +
    - The Lord, the mighty, the valiant, *
    - the Lord, the valiant in war.

    O gates, lift high your heads; +
    - grow higher, ancient doors. *
    - Let him enter, the king of glory!

    Who is he, the king of glory? +
    - He, the Lord of armies, *
    - he is the king of glory.
