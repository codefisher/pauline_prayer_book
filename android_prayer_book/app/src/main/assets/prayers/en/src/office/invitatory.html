<psalm>
    Come, ríng out our jóy to the Lórd; *
    - háil the Gód who sáves us.
    Let us cóme before him, gíving thánks, *
    - with sóngs let us háil the Lórd. <sp>R/</sp>

    A míghty Gód is the Lórd, *
    - a gréat king abóve all góds.
    In his hánd are the dépths of the éarth; *
    - the héights of the móuntains are hís.
    To hím belongs the séa, for he máde it *
    - and the drý land sháped by his hánds. <sp>R/</sp>

    Come ín; let us bów and bend lów; *
    - let us knéel before the Gód who máde us:
    for hé is our Gód and wé +
    - the péople who belóng to his pásture, *
    - the flóck that is léd by his hánd. <sp>R/</sp>

    O that todáy you would lísten to his vóice! +
    - &lsquo;Hárden not your héarts as at Meríbah, *
    - as on that dáy at Mássah in the désert
    when your fáthers pút me to the tést; *
    - when they tríed me, thóugh they saw my wórk. <sp>R/</sp>

    For forty yéars I was wéaried of these péople +
    - and I sáid: &ldquo;Their héarts are astráy, *
    - these péople do not knów my wáys.&rdquo;
    Thén I took an óath in my ánger: *
    - &ldquo;Néver shall they énter my rést.&rdquo; &rsquo; <sp>R/</sp>
</psalm>

<psalm>
    Cry out with jóy to the Lórd, all the éarth. *
    - Sérve the Lórd with gládness.
    Come befóre him, sínging for jóy. *
    - Know that hé, the Lórd, is Gód.

    He máde us, we belóng to hím, *
    - we are his péople, the shéep of his flóck.
    Gó within his gátes, giving thánks. *
    - Enter his cóurts with sóngs of práise.

    Give thánks to him and bléss his náme. *
    - Indéed, how góod is the Lórd,
    etérnal his mérciful lóve. *
    - He is fáithful from áge to áge.

<reading longref="Psalm 66 (67)"></reading>

<psalm>
    O Gód, be grácious and bléss us *
    - and let your fáce shed its líght upón us.
    So will your wáys be knówn upon éarth *
    - and all nátions learn your sáving hélp.

    Let the péoples práise you, O Gód; *
    - let áll the péoples práise you.

    Let the nátions be glád and exúlt *
    - for you rúle the wórld with jústice.
    With fáirness you rúle the péoples, *
    - you gúide the nátions on éarth.

    Let the péoples práise you, O Gód; *
    - let áll the péoples práise you.

    The éarth has yíelded its frúit *
    - for Gód, our Gód, has bléssed us.
    May Gód still gíve us his bléssing *
    - till the énds of the éarth revére him.

    Let the péoples práise you, O Gód; *
    - let áll the péoples práise you.
</psalm>

<reading longref="Psalm 23 (24)"></reading>

<psalm>
    The Lórd’s is the éarth and its fúllness, *
    - the wórld and áll its péoples.
    It is hé who sét it on the séas; *
    - on the wáters he máde it fírm.

    Who shall clímb the móuntain of the Lórd? *
    - Who shall stánd in his hóly pláce?
    The mán with clean hánds and pure héart, +
    - who desíres not wórthless thíngs, *
    - who has not swórn so as to déceive his néighbour.

    He shall recéive bléssings from the Lórd *
    - and rewárd from the Gód who sáves him.
    Súch are the mén who séek him, *
    - seek the fáce of the Gód of Jácob.

    O gátes, lift hígh your héads; +
    - grow hígher, áncient dóors. *
    - Let him énter, the kíng of glóry!

    Whó is the kíng of glóry? +
    - The Lórd, the míghty, the váliant, *
    - the Lórd, the váliant in wár.

    O gátes, lift hígh your héads; +
    - grow hígher, áncient dóors. *
    - Let him énter, the kíng of glóry!

    Who is hé, the kíng of glóry? +
    - Hé, the Lórd of ármies, *
    - hé is the kíng of glóry.
