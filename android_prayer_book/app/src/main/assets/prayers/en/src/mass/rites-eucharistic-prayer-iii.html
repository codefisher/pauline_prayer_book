    Then follows the Preface to be used in accord with the rubrics, which concludes:
</p>

<litany class="strong">
    Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.
    Heaven and earth are full of your glory.
    Hosanna in the highest.
    Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
    Hosanna in the highest.

    The Priest, with hands extended, says:

    <p dropcap="dropcap">
        You <strong> are indeed Holy, O Lord, <br />
        and all you have created <br />
        rightly gives you praise,<br />
        for through your Son our Lord Jesus Christ,<br />
        by the power and working of the Holy Spirit,<br />
        you give life to all things and make them holy,<br />
        and you never cease to gather a people to yourself,<br />
        so that from the rising of the sun to its setting<br />
        a pure sacrifice may be offered to your name.

    He joins his hands and, holding them extended over the offerings, says:
</p>

<div aside="<span class='rubric'>CC</span>">
    <strong>Therefore, O Lord, we humbly implore you:<br />
        by the same Spirit graciously make holy<br />
        these gifts we have brought to you for consecration,</strong>

<p class="rubric">
He joins his hands<br />
and makes the Sign of the Cross once over the bread and chalice together, saying:
</p>

<litany class="strong">
    that they may become the Body and <span class="cross">â˜©</span> Blood
    of your Son our Lord Jesus Christ,

<p class="rubric" number="110.">
    In the formulas that follow, the words of the Lord should be pronounced clearly
    and distinctly, as the nature of these words requires.
</p>

<litany class="strong">
    For on the night he was betrayed
</litany>

<p class="rubric">
    He takes the bread <br />
    and, holding it slightly raised above the altar, continues:
</p>

<litany class="strong">
    he himself took bread,
    and, giving you thanks, he said the blessing,
    broke the bread and gave it to his disciples, saying:
</litany>

<p class="rubric">
    He bows slightly.
</p>

<litany class="strong">
TAKE THIS, ALL OF YOU, AND EAT OF IT,
FOR THIS IS MY BODY,
WHICH WILL BE GIVEN UP FOR YOU.
</litany>

<p class="rubric">
    He shows the consecrated host to the people, places it again on the paten, and genuflects in adoration.
</p>

<p class="rubric" number="111.">
    After this, he continues:
</p>

<litany class="strong">
    In a similar way, when supper was ended,
</litany>

<p class="rubric">
    He takes the chalice <br />
    and, holding it slightly raised above the altar, continues:
</p>

<litany class="strong">
    he took the chalice,
    and, giving you thanks, he said the blessing,

<litany class="strong" includeblank="includeblank">
    TAKE THIS, ALL OF YOU, AND DRINK FROM IT,
    FOR THIS IS THE CHALICE OF MY BLOOD,

    FOR THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS.

    DO THIS IN MEMORY OF ME.
