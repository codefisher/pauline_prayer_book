<litany>
    O God almighty and merciful Father,
    grant we beseech you that imitating the example
    of the penitential and hidden life of blessed Mary
    we may by her intercession be awakened to the new life of the Gospel of your Son.
    Through our Lord Jesus Christ your Son,
    who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
    one God, for ever and ever.
</litany>
