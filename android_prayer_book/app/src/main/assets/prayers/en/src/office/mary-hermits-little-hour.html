<h2>Prayer During the Day</h2>

<reading label="Hymn"></reading>

<psalm>
    Mary, crowned with living light,
    Temple of the Lord,
    Place of peace and holiness,
    Shelter of the Word.

    Mystery of sinless life
    In our fallen race,
    Free from shadow you reflect
    Plenitude of grace.

    Virgin-mother of our God,
    Lift us when we fall,
    Who were named upon the Cross
    Mother of us all.

    Father, Son and Holy Ghost,
    Heaven sings your praise,
    Mary magnifies your name
    Through eternal days.
</psalm>

<psalm>
    To yóu have I lífted up my éyes, *
    - you who dwéll in the héavens;
    my éyes, like the éyes of sláves *
    - on the hánd of their lórds.

    Líke the éyes of a sérvant *
    - on the hánd of her místress,
    so our éyes are on the Lórd our Gód *
    - till he shów us his mércy.

    Have mércy on us, Lórd, have mércy. *
    - We are fílled with contémpt.
    Indéed all too fúll is our sóul +
    - with the scórn of the rích, *
    - with the próud man’s disdáin.
</psalm>

<reading shorttag="Our help is in the name of the Lord" ref="Psalm 123 (124)"></reading>

<psalm>
    &lsquo;If the Lórd had not béen on our síde,&rsquo; *
    - this is Ísrael’s sóng.
    &lsquo;If the Lórd had not béen on our síde *
    - when mén rose up agáinst us,
    thén would they have swállowed us alíve *
    - when their ánger was kíndled.

    &lsquo;Thén would the wáters have engúlfed us, *
    - the tórrent gone óver us;
    óver our héad would have swépt *
    - the ráging wáters.&rsquo;

    Bléssed be the Lórd who did not gíve us *
    - a préy to their téeth!
    Our lífe, like a bírd, has escáped *
    - from the snáre of the fówler.

    Indéed the snáre has been bróken *
    - and wé have escáped.
    Our hélp is in the náme of the Lórd, *
    - who made héaven and éarth.
</psalm>

<reading shorttag="The Lord, the protector of his people" ref="Psalm 124 (125)"></reading>

<psalm>
    Thóse who put their trúst in the Lórd +
    - are like Mount Síon, that cánnot be sháken, *
    - that stánds for éver.

    Jerúsalem! The móuntains surróund her, +
    - so the Lórd surróunds his péople *
    - both nów and for éver.

    For the scéptre of the wícked shall not rést *
    - over the lánd of the júst
    for féar that the hánds of the júst *
    - should túrn to évil.

    Do góod, Lord, to thóse who are góod, *
    - to the úpright of héart;
    but the cróoked and thóse who do évil, *
    - dríve them awáy!

    On Ísrael, péace!
