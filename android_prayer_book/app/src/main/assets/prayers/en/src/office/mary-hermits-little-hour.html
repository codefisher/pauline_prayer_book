<h2>Prayer During the Day</h2>

<reading label="Hymn"></reading>

<psalm>
    Mary, crowned with living light,
    Temple of the Lord,
    Place of peace and holiness,
    Shelter of the Word.

    Mystery of sinless life
    In our fallen race,
    Free from shadow you reflect
    Plenitude of grace.

    Virgin-mother of our God,
    Lift us when we fall,
    Who were named upon the Cross
    Mother of us all.

    Father, Son and Holy Ghost,
    Heaven sings your praise,
    Mary magnifies your name
    Through eternal days.
</psalm>

<reading shorttag="The Lord is the hope of his people" ref="Psalm 122 (123)"></reading>

<psalm>
    To you have I lifted up my eyes, *
    - you who dwell in the heavens :
    my eyes, like the eyes of slaves *
    - on the hand of their lords.

    Like the eyes of a servant *
    - on the hand of her mistress,
    so our eyes are on The Lord our God *
    - till he shows us his mercy.

    Have mercy on us, Lord, have mercy. *
    - We are filled with contempt.
    Indeed all too full is our soul †
    - with the scorn of the rich, *
    - with the proud man’s disdain.
</psalm>

<reading shorttag="Our help is in the name of the Lord" ref="Psalm 123 (124)"></reading>

<psalm>
    ‘If The Lord had been on our side,’ *
    - this is Israel’s song.
    ‘If The Lord had been on our side *
    - when men rose against us,
    then they would have swallowed us alive *
    - when their anger was kindled.

    Then would the waters have engulfed us, *
    - the torrent gone over us ;
    over our head would have swept *
    - the raging waters.’

    Blessed be The Lord who did not give us *
    - a prey to their teeth!
    Our life, like a bird, has escaped *
    - from the same snare of the fowler.

    Indeed the snare has been broken *
    - and we have escaped.
    Our help is in the name of The Lord, *
    - who made heaven and earth.
</psalm>

<reading shorttag="The Lord, the protector of his people" ref="Psalm 124 (125)"></reading>

<psalm>
    Those who put their trust in The Lord †
    - are like Mount Sion, that cannot be shaken, *
    - that stands forever.

    Jerusalem! The mountains surround her, †
    - so The Lord surrounds his people *
    - both now and forever.

    For the sceptre of the wicked shall not rest *
    - over the land of the just
    for fear that the hands of the just *
    - should turn to evil.

    Do good, Lord, to those who are good, *
    - to the upright of heart ;
    but the crooked and those who do evil, †
    - drive them away! *

    On Israel, peace!
