<h1 class="index">Chapter IV: Priestly Formation</h1>


<h2 id="norm101">Norm 101</h2>

<p>
    Every Priest of our Order is obliged after his ordination to engage in post-seminary formation
    for a period of five years. This is in order to enable him to gradually acclimatise himself to
    pastoral ministry and to life as a priest in a way that is consistent with the mission of the
    Order. This formation process takes place under the direction of a competent Priest who has been
    named by the Major Superior. This Priest is directly responsible for the formation itself.
</p>

<h2 id="norm102">Norm 102</h2>

<p>
    The program of on-going formation and Pastoral updating for new Priests consist of:
</p>

<ol class="alph">
    <li> Appropriate lectures, talks, conferences, courses, symposia, meetings, and congresses;</li>
    <li> Practical, pastoral experience which normally takes place in our own churches under the
        direction of the local Prior.
    </li>

</ol>

<h2 id="norm103">Norm 103</h2>

<p>
    Those undergoing post-seminary formation should take care that their priestly service be
    accompanied by a very deep union with Christ in the Holy Spirit. This should enrich their own
    personal life leading them to holiness. It is from this holiness that their priestly service
    will receive inner strength and reap a richer harvest.
</p>
<p>
    Their relationship with Mary, the Mother of the High Priest, to whom they consecrated themselves
    as Paulines, should be characterized by one of greater confidence in which they entrust their
    aspirations and hopes for a fruitful ministry to which they are called.
</p>
<p>
    In a special way they should take care to mesh their priesthood with Religious Life. In this way
    Religious Life is enriched and elevated through the priesthood and which in turn is able to
    strengthen and give them new life.
</p>

<h2 id="norm104">Norm 104</h2>

<p>
    A Priest in the five year formation program is bound not only to take part in the aforementioned
    methods of updating pastoral practice but are bound also to take an annual examination from
    these same courses as designated by the Bishop of the diocese in which they work or by the Major
    Superior.
</p>

<h2 id="norm105">Norm 105</h2>

<p>
    Before assigning Monks to specialised studies the Major Superior should seek out the opinion of
    those living in the House in which the candidate for studies has lived to this time.
</p>
<p>
    Those who are sent to study should take care that they do not neglect the deepening and
    development of their Vocation as Priests and Monks.
</p>
<p>
    Conscious of the fact that the Order has manifested to them its trust they should give
    themselves zealously to their studies so that they may complete them within the designated time
    frame.
</p>
<p>
    They should also give evidence of their work to the Major Superiors, for example, showing them
    their report cards and the results of their examinations. The Major Superior will immediately
    recall them from such studies should they be found negligent or lax in their work or not show
    forth positive results or unduly extend the time frame for their work and examinations or if
    they were to be a cause of scandal by their example.
</p>


<h2 id="norm106">Norm 106</h2>

<p>
    In each of our houses over and above the Normal pastoral meetings, which take place for the
    purpose of planning and organising day-to-day work there, is to be a monthly conference of the
    Fathers properly prepared concerning realistic themes in Pastoral Theology.
</p>
<p>
    Those taking part in such conferences should in a relaxed but well-ordered manner and directed
    on by a competent person should then engage in an exchange of thinking, viewpoints and
    experiences. All this in connection with the short lecture be based on current professional
    writings. In this manner, they can seek out ways in which they can deepen and enrich their own
    Pastoral ministry and as a way of seeing solutions to the serious problems connected with it.
</p>
<p>
    The themes of these conferences should be reported yearly in the report sent by the Prior to the
    Major Superior.
