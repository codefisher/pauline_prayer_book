<h2>Series I (Before Noon)</h2>

<reading shorttag="Longing for peace" ref="Psalm 119 (120)"></reading>

<psalm>
    To the Lórd in the hóur of my distréss *
    - I cáll and he ánswers me.
    &lsquo;O Lórd, save my sóul from lying líps, *
    - from the tóngue of the decéitful.&rsquo;

    Whát shall he páy you in retúrn, *
    - O tréacherous tóngue?
    The wárrior’s árrows shárpened *
    - and cóals, red-hot, blázing.

    Alas, that I abíde a stránger in Méshech, *
    - dwell among the ténts of Kédar!

    Long enóugh have Í been dwélling *
    - with thóse who hate péace.
    Í am for péace, but when I spéak, *
    - théy are for fíghting.
</psalm>

<reading shorttag="God, the protector of his people" ref="Psalm 120 (121)"></reading>

<psalm>
    I líft up my éyes to the móuntains: *
    - from whére shall come my hélp?
    My hélp shall cóme from the Lórd *
    - who made héaven and éarth.

    May he néver állow you to stúmble! *
    - Let him sléep not, your gúard.
    Nó, he sléeps not nor slúmbers, *
    - Ísrael’s gúard.

    The Lórd is your gúard and your sháde; *
    - t your ríght side he stánds.
    By dáy the sún shall not smíte you *
    - nor the móon in the níght.

    The Lórd will gúard you from évil, *
    - he will gúard your sóul.
    The Lord will gúard your góing and cóming *
    - both nów and for éver.
</psalm>

<reading shorttag="The holy city of Jerusalem" ref="Psalm 121 (122)"></reading>

<psalm>
    I rejóiced when I héard them sáy: *
    - &lsquo;Let us gó to God’s hóuse.&rsquo;
    And nów our féet are stánding *
    - within your gátes, O Jerúsalem.

    Jerúsalem is búilt as a cíty *
    - stróngly cómpact.
    It is thére that the tríbes go úp, *
    - the tríbes of the Lórd.

    For Ísrael’s láw it ís, *
    - there to práise the Lord’s náme.
    Thére were set the thrónes of júdgement *
    - of the hóuse of Dávid.

    For the péace of Jerúsalem práy: *
    - &lsquo;Péace be to your hómes!
    May péace réign in your wálls, *
    - in your pálaces, péace!&rsquo;

    For lóve of my bréthren and fríends *
    - I say: &lsquo;Péace upon yóu!&rsquo;
    For lóve of the hóuse of the Lórd *
    - I will ásk for your góod.
</psalm>

<h2>Series II (Midday)</h2>

<reading shorttag="The Lord is the hope of his people" ref="Psalm 122 (123)"></reading>

<psalm>
    To yóu have I lífted up my éyes, *
    - you who dwéll in the héavens;
    my éyes, like the éyes of sláves *
    - on the hánd of their lórds.

    Líke the éyes of a sérvant *
    - on the hánd of her místress,
    so our éyes are on the Lórd our Gód *
    - till he shów us his mércy.

    Have mércy on us, Lórd, have mércy. *
    - We are fílled with contémpt.
    Indéed all too fúll is our sóul +
    - with the scórn of the rích, *
    - with the próud man’s disdáin.
</psalm>

<reading shorttag="Our help is in the name of the Lord" ref="Psalm 123 (124)"></reading>

<psalm>
    &lsquo;If the Lórd had not béen on our síde,&rsquo; *
    - this is Ísrael’s sóng.
    &lsquo;If the Lórd had not béen on our síde *
    - when mén rose up agáinst us,
    thén would they have swállowed us alíve *
    - when their ánger was kíndled.

    &lsquo;Thén would the wáters have engúlfed us, *
    - the tórrent gone óver us;
    óver our héad would have swépt *
    - the ráging wáters.&rsquo;

    Bléssed be the Lórd who did not gíve us *
    - a préy to their téeth!
    Our lífe, like a bírd, has escáped *
    - from the snáre of the fówler.

    Indéed the snáre has been bróken *
    - and wé have escáped.
    Our hélp is in the náme of the Lórd, *
    - who made héaven and éarth.
</psalm>

<reading shorttag="The Lord, the protector of his people" ref="Psalm 124 (125)"></reading>

<psalm>
    Thóse who put their trúst in the Lórd +
    - are like Mount Síon, that cánnot be sháken, *
    - that stánds for éver.

    Jerúsalem! The móuntains surróund her, +
    - so the Lórd surróunds his péople *
    - both nów and for éver.

    For the scéptre of the wícked shall not rést *
    - over the lánd of the júst
    for féar that the hánds of the júst *
    - should túrn to évil.

    Do góod, Lord, to thóse who are góod, *
    - to the úpright of héart;
    but the cróoked and thóse who do évil, *
    - dríve them awáy!

    On Ísrael, péace!
</psalm>

<h2>Series III (Afternoon)</h2>

<reading shorttag="Joy and hope in God" ref="Psalm 125 (126)"></reading>

<psalm>
    When the Lórd delivered Síon from bóndage, *
    - it séemed like a dréam.
    Thén was our móuth filled with láughter, *
    - on our líps there were sóngs.

    The héathens themsélves said: &lsquo;What márvels *
    - the Lórd worked for thém!&rsquo;
    What márvels the Lórd worked for ús! *
    - Indéed we were glád.

    Delíver us, O Lórd, from our bóndage *
    - as stréams in dry lánd.
    Thóse who are sówing in téars *
    - will síng when they réap.

    They go óut, they go óut, full of téars, *
    - carrying séed for the sówing:
    they come báck, they come báck, full of sóng, *
    - cárrying their shéaves.
</psalm>

<reading shorttag="Success depends on the Lord’s blessing" ref="Psalm 126 (127)"></reading>

<psalm>
    If the Lórd does not búild the hóuse, *
    - in váin do its búilders lábour;
    if the Lórd does not wátch over the cíty, *
    - in váin does the wátchman keep vígil.

    In váin is your éarlier rísing, *
    - your góing láter to rést,
    you who tóil for the bréad you éat, *
    - when he pours gífts on his belóved while they slúmber.

    Truly sóns are a gíft from the Lórd, *
    - a bléssing, the frúit of the wómb.
    Indéed the sóns of yóuth *
    - are like árrows in the hánd of a wárrior.

    Ó the háppiness of the mán *
    - who has fílled his quíver with these árrows!
    Hé will have no cáuse for sháme *
    -0 when he dispútes with his fóes in the gáteways.
</psalm>

<reading shorttag="Peace in the home, a gift from the Lord" ref="Psalm 127 (128)"></reading>

<psalm>
    O bléssed are thóse who fear the Lórd *
    - and wálk in his wáys!

    By the lábour of your hánds you shall éat. *
    - You will be háppy and prósper;
    your wífe like a frúitful víne *
    - in the héart of your hóuse;
    your chíldren like shóots of the ólive, *
    - aróund your táble.

    Indéed thús shall be bléssed *
    - the mán who fears the Lórd.
    May the Lórd bléss you from Síon *
    - all the dáys of your lífe!
    May you sée your chíldren’s chíldren *
    - in a háppy Jerúsalem!

    On Ísrael, péace!
</psalm>

<reading shorttag="The people renew their confidence in the Lord after a time of affliction" ref="Psalm 128 (129)"></reading>

<p id="ps128">
    <em>The church tells of the sufferings it endures</em> (St. Augustine)
</p>

<psalm>
    &lsquo;They have préssed me hárd from my yóuth,&rsquo; *
    - this is Ísrael’s sóng.
    &lsquo;They have préssed me hárd from my yóuth *
    - but could néver destróy me.

    They plóughed my báck like plóughmen, *
    - drawing lóng fúrrows.
    But the Lórd who is júst, has destróyed *
    - the yóke of the wícked.&rsquo;

    Lét them be shámed and róuted, *
    - thóse who hate Síon!
    Lét them be like gráss on the róof *
    - that wíthers befóre it flówers.

    With thát no réaper fills his árms, +
    - no bínder makes his shéaves *
    - and thóse passing bý will not sáy:
    &lsquo;On yóu the Lord’s bléssing! *
    - We bléss you in the náme of the Lórd.&rsquo;

</p>

<psalm>
    O Lórd, my héart is not próud *
    - nor háughty my éyes.
    I have not góne after thíngs too gréat *
    - nor márvels beyónd me.

    Trúly I have sét my sóul *
    - in sílence and péace.
    A weaned chíld on its móther’s bréast, *
    - even só is my sóul.

    O Ísrael, hópe in the Lórd *
    - both nów and for éver.
