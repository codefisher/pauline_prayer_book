<h2>Series I (Before Noon)</h2>

<reading shorttag="Longing for peace" ref="Psalm 119 (120)"></reading>

<psalm>
    To the Lord in the hour of my distress *
    -  I call and he answers me.
    ‘O Lord, save my soul from lying lips, *
    -  from the tongue of the deceitful.’

    What shall he pay you in return, *
    -  O treacherous tongue?
    The warrior’s arrows sharpened *
    -  and coals, red-hot, blazing.

    Alas, that I abide a stranger in Meshech, *
    -  dwell among the tents of Kedar!

    Long enough have I been dwelling *
    -  with those who hate peace.
    I am for peace, but when I speak, *
    -  they are for fighting.
</psalm>

<reading shorttag="God, the protector of his people" ref="Psalm 120 (121)"></reading>

<psalm>
    I lift up my eyes to the mountains: *
    -  from where shall come my help?
    My help shall come from the Lord *
    -  who made heaven and earth.

    May he never allow you to stumble! *
    -  Let him sleep not, your guard.
    No, he sleeps not nor slumbers, *
    -  Israel’s guard.

    The Lord is your guard and your shade; *
    -  at your right side he stands.
    By day the sun shall not smite you *
    -  nor the moon in the night.

    The Lord will guard you from evil, *
    -  he will guard your soul.
    The Lord will guard your going and coming *
    -  both now and for ever.
</psalm>

<reading shorttag="The holy city of Jerusalem" ref="Psalm 121 (122)"></reading>

<psalm>
    I rejoiced when I heard them say: *
    -  ‘Let us go to God’s house.’
    And now our feet are standing *
    -  within your gates, O Jerusalem.

    Jerusalem is built as a city *
    -  strongly compact.
    It is there that the tribes go up, *
    -  the tribes of the Lord.

    For Israel’s law it is, *
    -  there to praise the Lord’s name.
    There were set the thrones of judgement *
    -  of the house of David.

    For the peace of Jerusalem pray: *
    -  ‘Peace be to your homes!
    May peace reign in your walls, *
    -  in your palaces, peace!’

    For love of my brethren and friends *
    -  I say: ‘Peace upon you!’
    For love of the house of the Lord *
    -  I will ask for your good.
</psalm>

<h2>Series II (Midday)</h2>

<reading shorttag="The Lord is the hope of his people" ref="Psalm 122 (123)"></reading>

<psalm>
    To you have I lifted up my eyes, *
    - you who dwell in the heavens :
    my eyes, like the eyes of slaves *
    - on the hand of their lords.

    Like the eyes of a servant *
    - on the hand of her mistress,
    so our eyes are on The Lord our God *
    - till he shows us his mercy.

    Have mercy on us, Lord, have mercy. *
    - We are filled with contempt.
    Indeed all too full is our soul †
    - with the scorn of the rich, *
    - with the proud man’s disdain.
</psalm>

<reading shorttag="Our help is in the name of the Lord" ref="Psalm 123 (124)"></reading>

<psalm>
    ‘If The Lord had been on our side,’ *
    - this is Israel’s song.
    ‘If The Lord had been on our side *
    - when men rose against us,
    then they would have swallowed us alive *
    - when their anger was kindled.

    Then would the waters have engulfed us, *
    - the torrent gone over us ;
    over our head would have swept *
    - the raging waters.’

    Blessed be The Lord who did not give us *
    - a prey to their teeth!
    Our life, like a bird, has escaped *
    - from the same snare of the fowler.

    Indeed the snare has been broken *
    - and we have escaped.
    Our help is in the name of The Lord, *
    - who made heaven and earth.
</psalm>

<reading shorttag="The Lord, the protector of his people" ref="Psalm 124 (125)"></reading>

<psalm>
    Those who put their trust in The Lord †
    - are like Mount Sion, that cannot be shaken, *
    - that stands forever.

    Jerusalem! The mountains surround her, †
    - so The Lord surrounds his people *
    - both now and forever.

    For the sceptre of the wicked shall not rest *
    - over the land of the just
    for fear that the hands of the just *
    - should turn to evil.

    Do good, Lord, to those who are good, *
    - to the upright of heart ;
    but the crooked and those who do evil, †
    - drive them away! *

    On Israel, peace!
</psalm>

<h2>Series III (Afternoon)</h2>

<reading shorttag="Joy and hope in God" ref="Psalm 125 (126)"></reading>

<psalm>
    When the Lord delivered Zion from bondage, *
    -  it seemed like a dream.
    Then was our mouth filled with laughter, *
    -  on our lips there were songs.

    The heathens themselves said: ‘What marvels *
    -  the Lord worked for them!’
    What marvels the Lord worked for us! *
    -  Indeed we were glad.

    Deliver us, O Lord, from our bondage *
    -  as streams in dry land.
    Those who are sowing in tears *
    -  will sing when they reap.

    They go out, they go out, full of tears, *
    -  carrying seed for the sowing:
    they come back, they come back, full of song, *
    -  carrying their sheaves.
</psalm>

<reading shorttag="Success depends on the Lord’s blessing" ref="Psalm 126 (127)"></reading>

<psalm>
    If the Lord does not build the house, *
    -  in vain do its builders labour;
    if the Lord does not watch over the city, *
    -  in vain does the watchman keep vigil.

    In vain is your earlier rising, *
    -  your going later to rest,
    you who toil for the bread you eat, *
    -  when he pours gifts on his beloved while they slumber.

    Truly sons are a gift from the Lord, *
    -  a blessing, the fruit of the womb.
    Indeed the sons of youth *
    -  are like arrows in the hand of a warrior.

    O the happiness of the man *
    -  who has filled his quiver with these arrows!
    He will have no cause for shame *
    -  when he disputes with his foes in the gateways.
</psalm>

<reading shorttag="Peace in the home, a gift from the Lord" ref="Psalm 127 (128)"></reading>

<psalm>
    O blessed are those who fear the Lord *
    -  and walk in his ways!
    By the labour of your hands you shall eat. *
    -  You will be happy and prosper;

    your wife like a fruitful vine *
    -  in the heart of your house;
    your children like shoots of the olive, *
    -  around your table.

    Indeed thus shall be blessed *
    -  the man who fears the Lord.
    May the Lord bless you from Zion *
    -  all the days of your life!
    May you see your children’s children *
    -  in a happy Jerusalem!

    On Israel, peace!
</psalm>

<p class="instruction">
    Sometimes the commons suggest Psalms that may replace some of the above, they are put here for convenience,
</p>

<reading shorttag="The people renew their confidence in the Lord after a time of affliction" ref="Psalm 128 (129)"></reading>

<p id="ps128">
    <em>The church tells of the sufferings it endures</em> (St Augustine)
</p>

<psalm>
    ‘They have pressed me hard from my youth,’ *
    - this is Israel’s song.
    ‘They have pressed me hard from my youth *
    - but could never destroy me.

    They ploughed my back like ploughmen, *
    - drawing long furrows.
    But the Lord who is just, has destroyed *
    - the yoke of the wicked.’

    Let them be shamed and routed, *
    - those who hate Zion!
    Let them be like grass on the roof *
    - that withers before it flowers.

    With that no reaper fills his arms, +
    - no binder makes his sheaves *
    - and those passing by will not say:
    ‘On you the Lord’s blessing! *
    - We bless you in the name of the Lord.’
</psalm>

<reading shorttag="" ref="Psalm 130 (131)"></reading>

<p id="ps130">
    <em>Learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart</em> (Mt 11:29)
</p>

<psalm>
    O Lord, my heart is not proud *
    - nor haughty my eyes.
    I have not gone after things too great *
    - nor marvels beyond me.

    Truly I have set my soul *
    - in silence and peace.
    A weaned child on its mother’s breast, *
    - even so is my soul.

    O Israel, hope in the Lord *
    - both now and for ever.
</psalm>
