<litany>
    O God, who called Blessed Eusebius
    into the wilderness of Pilis out of his love for you,
    that there he might offer his life in propitiation for the people
    and gather the scattered hermits,
    grant, we beseech you, that through his life and intercession
    our order may be made one in faith and love.
    Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
    who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
    one God, for ever and ever.
</litany>
