<h2><span class="rubric">Memorial</span></h2>

<p><em>
    Mary was born in Egypt between the fourth and sixth Centuries. At age twelve, she ran away from home and
    gave herself to loose living. After a sin-filled seventeen years, when she could not enter the Church
    of the Holy Sepulchre she converted and abandoned her life thus far. She left for the Jordan
    Desert, where she spent many penitential years in solitude, with various mortifications and
    fasts.
