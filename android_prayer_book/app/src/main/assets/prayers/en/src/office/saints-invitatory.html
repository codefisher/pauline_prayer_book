    Psalm 94 (95)
</p>

<psalm>
    Come, ríng out our jóy to the Lórd; *
    - háil the Gód who sáves us.
    Let us cóme before him, gíving thánks, *
    - with sóngs let us háil the Lórd.&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>

    A míghty Gód is the Lórd, *
    - a gréat king abóve all góds.
    In his hánd are the dépths of the éarth; *
    - the héights of the móuntains are hís.
    To hím belongs the séa, for he máde it *
    - and the drý land sháped by his hánds.&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>

    Come ín; let us bów and bend lów; *
    - let us knéel before the Gód who máde us:
    for hé is our Gód and wé +
    - the péople who belóng to his pásture, *
    - the flóck that is léd by his hánd.&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>

    O that todáy you would lísten to his vóice! +
    - &lsquo;Hárden not your héarts as at Meríbah, *
    - as on that dáy at Mássah in the désert
    when your fáthers pút me to the tést; *
    - when they tríed me, thóugh they saw my wórk.&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>

    For forty yéars I was wéaried of these péople +
    - and I sáid: &ldquo;Their héarts are astráy, *
    - these péople do not knów my wáys.&rdquo;
    Thén I took an óath in my ánger: *
    - &ldquo;Néver shall they énter my rést.&rdquo; &rsquo;&nbsp;<sp>R/</sp>

    Glory be to the Father and to the Son *
    - and to the Holy Spirit,
    as it was in the beginning, +
    - is now, and ever shall be, *
    - world without end. Amen.
