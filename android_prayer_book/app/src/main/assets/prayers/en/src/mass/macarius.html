<h2><span class="rubric">Optional Memorial</span></h2>

<p><em>
    Macarius was born in Alexandria circa AD 300. In his youth, he went to the desert near Thebes,
    where he spent 29 years. Next, he moved to the Scetic Desert, where he gave himself to an even more
    rigorously penitential life. He was then ordained a priest. Living in prayer and fasting, he
    received the gift of prophecy as well the ability to work miracles.

<litany>
    O God, almighty Father, grant we beseech you,
    that we too imitate the life of the Abbot blessed Macarius,
    we may be made worthy of your supreme love
    and may receive with him a like reward
    from the everlasting spring of our Saviour Jesus Christ.
    Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
    one God, for ever and ever.
</litany>
