<h1>4. Saint Casimir</h1>

<p class="instruction">
    St. Casimir, a son of King Casimir Jaggielonczyk and
    Elizabeth Rakuska was born October 3, 1458 in Kraków at the
    royal castle of Wawel. He died March 4, 1484 and was buried at
    the Cathedral of Vilnius (Lithuania) where his relics are venerated
    to this day. His cult was approved by the Holy See in 1521 and
    ratified again by Pope Clement VIII in 1602. The same Pope also
    affirmed the liturgical texts of the Holy Mass and Divine Office and
    extended the feast of St. Casimir to be celebrated by the Universal
    Church.

<p class="instruction">
    St. Casimir was noted for his special grace of prayer and
    a filial devotion to the Mother of God, His favoured hymn to Mary
    was, “Omni die, dic Mariae” (sing to Mary every day). The text of
    this hymn was enclosed in his coffin. Along with his father he used
    to come to the Shrine of Our Lady of Jasna Gora. In 1472 the
    whole royal family prayed before the Miraculous Image and re-
    ceived Holy Communion. On that day, the royal family was admit-
    ted to the Pauline Confraternity, including the future saint, St.
    Casimir.
