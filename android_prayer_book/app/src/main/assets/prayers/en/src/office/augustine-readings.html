<psalm>
    This is the day whereon the Lord’s true witness,
    Whom all the nations lovingly do honour,
    Worthy at last was found to wear for ever
    -- Glory transcendent.

    Oft hands it been thro’ his sublime deserving
    Poor human bodies, howsoever stricken,
    Broke and cast off the bondage of their sickness
    -- Healed divinely.

    Healing and power, grace and beauteous honour
    Always be his, shining in the highest,
    Ruleth and keepeth all the world’s vast order,
    -- One God, three persons.

    O Lórd, your stréngth gives jóy to the kíng; *

    - In hím, my róck, there is no wróng.

<reading label="First Reading" ref="1:7-11; 2:1-8"
         tagline="The teaching of St. Paul on the qualities and duties of a bishop.">A
    reading from the letter of St. Paul to Titus
</reading>

<p>
    Since he is in charge of God's word, the church leader should be without fault. He must not be arrogant or quick tempered, or a drunkard, or violent, or greedy. He must be hospitable and love what is good. He must be self-controlled, upright, holy, and disciplined. He must hold firmly to the message which can be trusted and which agrees with the doctrine. In this way he will be able to encourage others with the true teaching, and also show the error of those who are opposed to it.
    </p>
<p>
    For there are many who rebel and deceive others with their nonsense, especially the converts from Judaism. It is necessary to stop their talking because they are upsetting whole families by teaching what they should not, for the shameful purpose of making money.
    </p>
<p>
    But you must teach what is required by sound doctrine. Tell the older men to be sober, sensible, and self-controlled; to be sound in their faith, love and endurance. Is the same way tell the older women to behave as women who live a holy life should. They must not be slanderers, or slaves to wine. They must teach what is good, in order to train the younger women to love their husbands and children, to be self-controlled and pure, and to be good housewives, who obey their husbands,so that no one will speak evil of the message from God.
</p>
<p>
    In the same way urge the young men to be self-controlled. You yourself, in all things, must be an example in good works. Be sincere and serious in your teaching. Use sound words that cannot be criticised, so that your enemies may be put to shame by not having anything bad to say, about us.

<reading label="Second Reading" longref="Bk 7,10,18; 10,27"
         tagline="O eternal truth and true love and beloved eternity">A
    reading from the <em>Confessions</em> of St. Augustine
</reading>

<p>
    Being admonished to return to myself I entered into my own depths, with you as guide; I was able
    to do this because you were my helper. I entered and with the eye of my soul, such as it was, I saw your
    unchangeable light shining over that same eye of my soul, over my mind. It was not the light of every day
    that eye of flesh can see, nor some greater light of the same order, such as might be of the brightness of our daily light should be seen shining with a more intense brightness and filling all things with its greatness.
    Your light was not that, but other, altogether other, than all such lights. Nor was it above my mind as oil above the water it floats on, not as the sky is above the earth;
    it was above because it made me, and I was below because made bu it. He who knows the truth knows that light, and the one who knows
    that light knows eternity. Charity knows it.
    O eternal truth and true love and beloved eternity! You are my God, I sigh for you day and
    night. When I first knew you, you lifted me up so that I might see that there was something to
    see, but I was not yet the man to see it. And you beat back the weakness of my gaze, blazing
    upon me too strongly, and I was shaken with love and with dread. And I knew that I was far from you
    in the region of unlikeness, as if I heard your voice from on high: ‘I am the food of grown men: grow and you
    shall eat me. And when you eat me, you shall not change me into yourself as bodily food, but into me you shall
    be changed.’
</p>
<p>
    So I set about finding a way to gain the strength necessary for enjoying you. And I could not
    find it until I embraced the mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus, who is over all
    things, God blessed forever, who was calling to me saying, I am the way, the truth and the life; and who
    brought into union with our nature that food which I lacked the strength to take: for the Word was made flesh that your wisdom, by which you created all things, might give suck to our souls' infancy.
</p>
<p>
    Late have I loved you, O Beauty, so ancient and so new; late have I loved you! For behold you were
    within me, and I outside; and I sought you outside, and in my ugliness fell upon those lovely
    things you have made. You were with me and I was not with you. I was kept from you by those
    things, yet had they not been in you, they would not have been at all. You called, you cried to
    me, you broke open my deafness: and you sent forth your beams and shone upon me and chased away my
    blindness: you breathed fragrance upon me, and I drew in my breath and do now pant for you: I
    tasted you, and now I hunger and thirst for you: you touched me and now I burn for your peace.

    <sp>R/</sp> Let Truth, the Light of my heart, speak to me, and not the voice of my own darkness. I wandered far away, yet I remembered you. <span class="rubric">*</span> See, now I return to your fountain, with longing and a burning thirst.
    <br />
    <sp>V/</sp> I myself am not the goal of my own existence. Left to myself, I lived in sin, bringing death upon myself. In you I have discovered life. <span class="rubric">*</span> See, now I return to your fountain, with longing and a burning thirst.

<reading label="Hymn">Te Deum</reading>

<psalm>
    We praise you, O God: *
    we acclaim you as the Lord.

    - Everlasting Father, *
    - all the world bows down before you.

    All the angels sing your praise, *
    the hosts of heaven and all the angelic powers,

    - all the cherubim and seraphim *
    - call out to you in unending song:

    -- <em>Holy, Holy, Holy,</em> *
    -- <em>is the Lord God of angel hosts!</em>

    The heavens and the earth are filled *
    with your majesty and glory.

    - The glorious band of apostles, *
    - the noble company of prophets,

    the white-robed army who shed their blood for Christ, *
    all sing your praise.

    - And to the ends of the earth *
    - your holy Church proclaims her faith in you:

    -- Father, whose majesty is boundless, +
    -- your true and only Son, who is to be adored, *
    -- the Holy Spirit sent to be our Advocate.

    You, Christ, are the king of glory, *
    Son of the eternal Father.

    - When you took our nature to save mankind *
    - you did not shrink from birth in the Virgin’s womb.

    You overcame the power of death *
    opening the Father’s kingdom to all who believe in you.

    - Enthroned at God’s right hand in the glory of the Father, *
    - you will come in judgement according to your promise.

    You redeemed your people by your precious blood. *
    Come, we implore you, to our aid.

    - Grant us with the saints *
    - a place in eternal glory.

    <span class="instruction">The final part of the hymn may be omitted:</span>

    Lord, save your people *
    and bless your inheritance.

    - Rule them and uphold them *
    - for ever and ever.

    Day by day we praise you: *
    we acclaim you now and to all eternity.

    - In your goodness, Lord, keep us free from sin. *
    - Have mercy on us, Lord, have mercy.

    May your mercy always be with us, Lord, *
    for we have hoped in you.

    - In you, Lord, we put our trust: *
    - we shall not be put to shame.

<reading label="Concluding Prayer"></reading>

<litany>Lord God, renew your Church
    with the Spirit of wisdom and love
    which you gave so fully to Saint Augustine.
    Lead us by that same Spirit to seek you,
    the only fountain of true wisdom
    and the source of everlasting love.
    Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
    who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
    one God, for ever and ever.
