<h1>5. An act of Consecration to the Mother of God</h1>

<p>
    Mother of God, Immaculate Mary, to you I consecrate my
    body and soul, all my prayers, works, joys and sufferings, all that I
    am and possess. With an eager heart, I dedicate myself to you in
    the service of love. I give you complete freedom in making use of
    me for the salvation of men and the assistance of the Holy Church
    of which you are the Mother.
</p>

<p>
    From now on, I wish to do everything with you, through
    you and for you. I know that by my own strength, I shall accom-
    plish nothing. You, however, can do everything that is the will of
    your Son and you are always victorious. Grant then, O Help of
    Christians, that my family, parish and my country, may truly be
    your and your Sonâ€™s Kingdom. Amen.
</p>
