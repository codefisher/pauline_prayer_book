<h1>12. An act of Consecration of Seminarians of the Pauline Order
    to the Queen of Jasna Gora.
    <span>(Jasna Gora, 9 September 1961)</span>
</h1>

<p>
    O powerful Queen of Poland and of the world!<br/>
    An hour of great decision for the whole humanity of today
    has arrived. It challenges and impels us to fall to our knees before
    your Miraculous Image and to turn our eyes and hearts toward you.
</p>

<p>
    We, the young members of the Pauline Order at this hallowed place, chosen by you as the Shrine of the Nation, wish to
    offer you our humble homage of an unwavering faith and deep
    gratitude, and to express our desire to dedicate our lives to your
    exclusive service. As Jesus, your Son and our Saviour and Leader,
    in his time chose his apostles and disciples, likewise today, you
    invite each one of us personally, to join the ranks of this Order, that
    carries on the joyous mission, entrusted by God, to proclaim the
    Kingdom of the Sacred Heart of Jesus on Earth.
</p>

<p>
    We are called to reveal you to the nation and to the world.
    Our nation and all of humanity, has an obligation, to know you
    better, and love you more ardently. You are the only true Mother
    and a great Teacher given to man. Therefore, he has a duty to accept and trust in you, knowing that the salvation of the world came
    through you.<br/>
    O Our Lady and Queen!
</p>

<p>
    From the bottom of our young hearts, we thank you above
    all for the gift of our good and believing parents, who enkindled in
    our hearts a great love for you and for the true Catholic Church.
</p>

<p>
    We thank you for the wonderful and glorious gift of our
    Monastic and Priestly vocation.
</p>

<p>
    We thank you with all our heart for your constant protection of our Order, especially of our houses of studies.
</p>

<p>
    We thank you for our professors and superiors and for
    graces showered upon us with such abundance that help us in
    achieving our goal: the holy priesthood and holiness. O how much
    we ought to love and honour you! Forgive us all our former and
    present transgressions, sins and negligence.
</p>

<p>
    Today, with your help, we want to begin writing a new
    book of life of our Seminary, of our nation and of the whole world.
</p>

<p>
    O our Beloved Lady of Jasna Gora! Embrace all of us,
    our Religious Family, and particularly our Seminary with your
    royal heart! Accept us as your perpetual possession, and all we are
    and have: our past, our present and our future. From now on, we
    are yours and yours alone! Use us well for your own royal designs.
    Enclose our houses of studies and religious properties within your
    arms and protect them from all dangers. Remove from us all mediocrity, compromise and discouragement. Excite us with great aspirations and with a steadfast faith in Jesus Christ and his final victory.
</p>

<p>
    Finally, we ask you, our Beloved Mother, that you may
    teach us how to love Our Lord Jesus Christ with all our hearts, with
    the example of St. Paul the Apostle, who still cries out: &#8221;The love
    of Christ urges us&#8230;Nothing therefore can come between us and the
    love of Christ, even if we are troubled or worried, or being persecuted, or lacking food or clothes, or being threatened or even attacked&#8230; For I am certain of this: neither death nor life, no angel, no
    prince, nothing that exists, nothing still to come, not any power, or
    height or depth, nor any created thing, can ever come between us
    and the love of God made visible in Christ Jesus our Lord&#8221; ( Rom.
    8:35-39). Amen.
