<h2 id="7-2-stations-of-the-cross">7.2 Stations of the Cross</h2>

<h3>The First Station
    <span>Jesus is condemned to death</span>
</h3>

<div class="prayer-group short-prayer">
    <div class="leader prayer short-prayer"><div class="prayer-red short-prayer">L.</div>We adore You, O Christ, and we praise You!
    </div><div class="prayer short-prayer"><div class="prayer-red short-prayer">All</div>Because by your Holy Cross, You have redeemed the world.
    </div></div>

<p>
    <em>&#8220;&#8230; but the Jews shouted still louder to crucify him&#8230; so in
    the end Pilate handed him over to them to be crucified &#8230;&#8221;</em>
</p>

<p>Every road of religious life begins with the first station of
    the cross. The decision to abandon the world, and to petition for
    admission at the Monastery door has passed. Was I fully aware
    that, like Christ, I was entering the road of the cross; truly a pilgrimage of the cross? Was I mindful of the truth that the sweetness
    of mystic experience will dawn upon me, only after the night of
    affliction?
</p>

<p>
    O most holy Will of God, may I seek only you and may
    the fulfilment of your Will be my greatest delight. Lord Jesus, may
    you be for my soul as a true vine to its branches.
</p>

<h3>The Second Station
    <span>Jesus accepts his cross</span>
</h3>

<div class="prayer-group short-prayer">
    <div class="leader prayer short-prayer"><div class="prayer-red short-prayer">L.</div>We adore You, O Christ, and we praise You!
    </div><div class="prayer short-prayer"><div class="prayer-red short-prayer">All</div>Because by your Holy Cross, You have redeemed the world.
    </div></div>

<p>Jesus began the road of his suffering in the Garden of
    Gethsemane. Later, the nocturnal interrogations, the crowning
    with thorns, the scourging, exhausted him, even before his passion.
</p>

    <p>
        On the day of my admission I felt very energetic and enthusiastic, ready to begin a new adventure, a new state of life. Because of my weakness, God, in His wisdom, did not allow me to
        foresee the heavy weight of the religious and priestly life. He did
        not want me to be disheartened before I had learned to depend on
        His grace alone.
    </p>

    <p>
        O Jesus, teach me to hold your image with the cross in my
        hands and in my heart, that I may have the wisdom to understand
        these words: &#8220;Once having made the choice, I have to choose anew
        constantly.&#8221; Teach me to remember the glorious message of
        Easter.
    </p>

    <h3>The Third Station
        <span>Jesus falls the first time</span>
    </h3>

    <div class="prayer-group short-prayer">
        <div class="leader prayer short-prayer"><div class="prayer-red short-prayer">L.</div>We adore You, O Christ, and we praise You!
        </div><div class="prayer short-prayer"><div class="prayer-red short-prayer">All</div>Because by your Holy Cross, You have redeemed the world.
        </div></div>

    <p>
        Jesus, because of the weight of the cross, and the noise of
        the pushing crowd, you begin to feel weak, unstable and shaky.
        You begin to stumble on the stony road and all of a sudden you fall
        to the ground.
    </p>

    <p>
        This can happen to me too, especially at the beginning of
        my religious formation. I discover in myself more and more areas
        that are totally alienated from the ideals of Holy Scripture, of my
        religious rules and of the ascetical writings which I am reading.
        These ideals contrast with my real human weakness. Then, I ask
        myself: &#8220;Is this the right place for me?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
        O Lord, be my strength when I become discouraged. I
        cannot depart from you. I will arise again and go on. Once again, I
        will look at my Brothers and discover in them a hidden greatness.
    </p>

    <h3>The Fourth Station
        <span>Jesus meets his sorrowful Mother</span>
    </h3>

    <div class="prayer-group short-prayer">
        <div class="leader prayer short-prayer"><div class="prayer-red short-prayer">L.</div>We adore You, O Christ, and we praise You!
        </div><div class="prayer short-prayer"><div class="prayer-red short-prayer">All</div>Because by your Holy Cross, You have redeemed the world.
        </div></div>

    <p>
        For a short time, the eyes of Jesus and Mary, his Mother,
        met in a sorrow beyond description. It was just a brief moment and
        yet it contained everything: their love, their pain, their determination and their obedience to the Will of the Eternal Father.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is a common conviction, that the decision to choose the
        consecrated religious life, is born in the heart of the Mother of God.
        Every good inspiration comes to us from heaven through the mediation of Mary, as an answer to her request: &#8220;they have no
        wine&#8221; (Jn 2:4). This is very true in every vocation to the Pauline
        Order.
    </p>

    <p>
        O Queen of Czestochowa! I am with you, I remember,
        and am vigilant to cherish the love of Jesus for me, the love that
        you have given me. May this love and devotion to your sweet
        name reign in my heart and engage all my emotions.
    </p>

    <h3>The Fifth Station
        <span>Simon of Cyrene helps Jesus to carry his cross</span>
    </h3>

    <div class="prayer-group short-prayer">
        <div class="leader prayer short-prayer"><div class="prayer-red short-prayer">L.</div>We adore You, O Christ, and we praise You!
        </div><div class="prayer short-prayer"><div class="prayer-red short-prayer">All</div>Because by your Holy Cross, You have redeemed the world.
        </div></div>

    <p>
        Simon, probably forced to carry the cross, did not realise
        whom he was helping, the important thing was he actually helped.
        A kind-hearted person would respond in the same way.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the time of distress, God does not leave us alone, but
        sends us a friend with encouragement. In the case of religious
        community life, it may be a spiritual director, a confessor, a superior or a brother. Through them, our heavenly Father watches over
        us and supports us in the time of our inner needs.
    </p>

    <p>
        May we always have the courage and strength to ask for,
        or accept, the help offered to us by other people, but always arranged by Divine Providence!
    </p>

    <h3>The Sixth Station
        <span>Veronica wipes the Face of Jesus</span>
    </h3>

    <div class="prayer-group short-prayer">
        <div class="leader prayer short-prayer"><div class="prayer-red short-prayer">L.</div>We adore You, O Christ, and we praise You!
        </div><div class="prayer short-prayer"><div class="prayer-red short-prayer">All</div>Because by your Holy Cross, You have redeemed the world.
        </div></div>

    <p>
        Out of great compassion, a courageous woman, by the
        name of Veronica wipes the bloody, sweaty face of her beloved
        Master on his way to Calvary. O St. Veronica you have done what
        I would do when I look on the afflicted face of my beloved Redeemer.
    </p>

    <p>
        Often, we see in our Monasteries persons, weighed down
        with keen, personal suffering of sickness or age. There is a need
        for great souls, filled with goodness, who would hasten with help
        and bring them solace and comfort. Sometimes, just a little kindness, a smile, a good word and above all a prayer, can change unexpectedly sadness into joy.
    </p>

    <p>
        O Jesus Christ, teach me to dry the tears, not only of my
        brothers in religious life, but also those that stream down the faces
        of my brothers and sisters in the confessional and at the Monastery door.
    </p>

    <h3>The Seventh Station
        <span>Jesus falls the second time
We adore you, O Christ, and we bless you!</span>
    </h3>

    <div class="prayer-group short-prayer">
        <div class="leader prayer short-prayer"><div class="prayer-red short-prayer">L.</div>We adore You, O Christ, and we praise You!
        </div><div class="prayer short-prayer"><div class="prayer-red short-prayer">All</div>Because by your Holy Cross, You have redeemed the world.
        </div></div>

    <p>
        What caused Jesus to fall again? Certainly not the cross,
        Simon of Cyrene carried it. Yes, yet Jesus noticed an evil desire in
        my soul beginning to take root. That is the real reason for the Saviour&#8217;s fall.
    </p>

    <p>
        Jesus cautions me with the words, once addressed to St.
        Peter: &#8220;&#8230; Simon, Simon, the devil has demanded your soul &#8230;&#8221; I
        ask and then answer with St. Paul the Apostle: &#8220;I am a miserable
        man! Who will deliver me from death of the flesh? The grace of
        God, through Jesus Christ &#8230;&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
        O Lord, defend me from Satan&#8217;s trap and from the frailty
        of my will.
    </p>

    <h3>The Eighth Station
        <span>Jesus consoles the women of Jerusalem</span>
    </h3>

    <div class="prayer-group short-prayer">
        <div class="leader prayer short-prayer"><div class="prayer-red short-prayer">L.</div>We adore You, O Christ, and we praise You!
        </div><div class="prayer short-prayer"><div class="prayer-red short-prayer">All</div>Because by your Holy Cross, You have redeemed the world.
        </div></div>

    <p>
        &#8220;Daughters of Jerusalem do not weep for me, but for your
        children.&#8221; Often, the world feels sorry for those who have left it,
        in order to serve God and his people exclusively. In its eyes, they
        seem to be foolish and na&#239;ve for not developing and using wisely
        their talents and for embracing all types of inconveniences &#8230; but it
        is a false, pagan sympathy. Behold our Lord and God who teaches
        us in the light of eternity by saying: Come, you blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom, prepared for you from the very foundation of the world.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>
        O Jesus, teach me to guard and increase the grace of my
        monastic, hermitical and apostolic vocation to live for God in solitude: &#8220;Alone with God, alone.&#8221;
    </p>

    <h3>The Ninth Station
        <span>Jesus falls the third time</span>
    </h3>

    <div class="prayer-group short-prayer">
        <div class="leader prayer short-prayer"><div class="prayer-red short-prayer">L.</div>We adore You, O Christ, and we praise You!
        </div><div class="prayer short-prayer"><div class="prayer-red short-prayer">All</div>Because by your Holy Cross, You have redeemed the world.
        </div></div>

    <p>
        A great loss of physical strength caused Jesus to collapse
        again, shortly before he arrived at Calvary hill. Before his public
        mission, Jesus was tempted by the devil upon another hill. O Lord,
        it was not the devil who struck you down. It was me. Through my
        arrogance and pride, I pushed and knocked you over, I, a man particularly consecrate to you. The pleasure of passion has begotten a
        sin and sin brought forth death.
    </p>

    <p>
        O Holy Spirit, give me the gift of prudence and courage
        that I may always resist the lustful thoughts and actions that tarnish
        purity of heart. O Immaculate Virgin Mary, my Mother, cover me
        with your mantle of purity and innocence and help me to keep my
        vow of chastity untainted.
    </p>

    <h3>The Tenth Station
        <span>Jesus is stripped of his garments</span>
    </h3>

    <div class="prayer-group short-prayer">
        <div class="leader prayer short-prayer"><div class="prayer-red short-prayer">L.</div>We adore You, O Christ, and we praise You!
        </div><div class="prayer short-prayer"><div class="prayer-red short-prayer">All</div>Because by your Holy Cross, You have redeemed the world.
        </div></div>

    <p>
        The world in its immoderate appetite for sensuality, goes
        so far as it dares to disrobe even God-Man himself of his divine
        and human dignity. May the darkness of which the Gospels speak,
        envelop the hill of Golgotha and cover the humiliated Lord, exposed to the jeer of the crowd. Every person, even the consecrated,
        may strip himself of sanctifying grace, by breaking the virtues and
        the vows of chastity, poverty and obedience. Through a grievous
        infidelity to the religious consecration, a Father or a Brother exposes himself to a most humiliating darkness.
    </p>

    <p>
        O Jesus, my Lord! May I never depart from your Holy
        Will, because of the lack of vigilance on my part. May the sign of
        my habit, constantly remind me of my consecration and may it
        strengthen the faith of the people I serve.
    </p>

    <h3>The Eleventh Station
        <span>Jesus is nailed to the Cross</span>
    </h3>

    <div class="prayer-group short-prayer">
        <div class="leader prayer short-prayer"><div class="prayer-red short-prayer">L.</div>We adore You, O Christ, and we praise You!
        </div><div class="prayer short-prayer"><div class="prayer-red short-prayer">All</div>Because by your Holy Cross, You have redeemed the world.
        </div></div>

    <p>
        &#8220;When they arrived at Golgotha, they crucified him
        there.&#8221; Jesus himself stretched out his arms and feet for the nailing. This was his decision to obey his Father in everything.
    </p>

    <p>
        O Jesus, my Lord! For you I have left my family and
        friends; for you, I have disowned my property; for you, I have
        given up the right to exercise my personal freedom; for you, I have
        decided to follow the evangelical counsels, the constitutions and
        directory of my Pauline Order. This is my cross! This is my inadequate imitation of you!
    </p>

    <p>
        &#8220;O Lord Jesus! to you, I want to offer everything, and for
        you, I desire to live and die.&#8221; Defend me, O Lord Jesus from the
        temptation to come down from the cross of my religious vows,
        pronounced in the Order of St. Paul the First Hermit.
    </p>

    <h3>The Twelfth Station
        <span>Jesus dies on the Cross</span>
    </h3>

    <div class="prayer-group short-prayer">
        <div class="leader prayer short-prayer"><div class="prayer-red short-prayer">L.</div>We adore You, O Christ, and we praise You!
        </div><div class="prayer short-prayer"><div class="prayer-red short-prayer">All</div>Because by your Holy Cross, You have redeemed the world.
        </div></div>

    <p>
        When we were still in the slavery of sin, Jesus delivered
        himself for our sake to death, a death on the cross. St John, the
        beloved Apostle, testified to this love when he wrote: &#8220;Those who
        were his own, he loved them to the end.&#8221;
    </p>

        The Crucified Lord awaits my self-denial in the monastic
        community life. He expects my share in his bitter passion and crucifixion. The Lord allowed his Sacred Heart to be pierced to show
        me the height and depth, the length and breadth of his love for me.
        His Heart was opened wide to be my refuge and my hiding place,
        whenever I feel ashamed because of my shortcomings and even
        serious failures.
    </p>

    <p>
        O Lord Jesus, I confess my weakness. I know that without you, I can do nothing. Inflame my soul with the fire of your
        love that I may love you above all things and my brothers for your
        sake, remembering the words of St. Paul, the Apostle&#8221; &#8220;&#8230; but
        without love, nothing can help me&#8230;&#8221; (2Cor 13: 1-13).

        O my sweet Jesus, I will be eternally grateful to you in

        <p>I will remain under your Cross, my Lord and Redeemer,
            when people praise me. I will recall your humiliation, that my vanity may be humiliated.
        </p>
        <p>I will remain under your Cross, my Lord and Redeemer,
            when people reproach me.
        </p>
        <p>I will recall your silence, that my lips may be sealed.</p>
        <p>I will remain under your Cross, my Lord and Redeemer,
            when people will persecute me. I will remember the scourging of
            your sacred Body, that my self-love may be abased.
        </p>
        <p>I will remain under your Cross, my Lord and Redeemer,
            when I will suffer shortage of necessities, and I will remember
            your poverty. Teach me to rejoice in my material and spiritual
            deficiencies
        </p>
        <p>I will remain under your Cross, my Lord and Redeemer,
            when evil thoughts disturb my mind. I will remember your crowning with thorns, that my thoughts may be calm and collected.
        </p>
        <p>I will remain under your Cross, my Lord and Redeemer,
            when evil passions storm my heart. I will be mindful of your
            bruised body, that I may overcome the temptation of the flesh.
        </p>
        <p>I will remain under your Cross, my Lord and Redeemer,
            when people judge me unjustly. I will pray for them: &#8220;Our Father,
            forgive them.&#8221; Teach me to forgive always.
        </p>
        <p>I will remain under your Cross, my Lord and Redeemer,
            when my conscience accuses me and leads me to desperation. I
            will recall your words spoken to the thief:
            &#8220;Today you will be with me in paradise.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>I will remain under your Cross, my Lord and Redeemer,
            when the world and people reject me. I will remember the words,
            addressed to your Mother: &#8220;Woman behold your son.&#8221; She will
            console me.
        </p>
        <p>I will remain under your Cross, my Lord and Redeemer,
            when the darkness overshadows my soul. Your cross will give me
            light. When my strength begins to fail, your cross will fortify me.
            When my life path starts to deviate, your cross will show me the
            way.
        </p>
        <p>I will remain under your Cross, my Lord and Redeemer,
            when people will not welcome me into their homes and hearts. Then, I will place my head and heart on the wood of your cross.
        </p>
        <p>My Lord and Redeemer, always and everywhere I want to
            live and die under your cross.
        </p>
        <p>Under your cross, I wish to shed my bitter tears for my
            sins. On your cross, you have wrought the salvation of the human
            race. Under your cross, I also desire to work and shed tears for my
            salvation.

    <p>
        My good and dearest Jesus, lo, I kneel before you beseeching and praying to you with all the ardour of my soul to engrave deep and vivid impressions of faith, hope, and charity upon
        my heart, with true repentance for my sins, and a very firm resolve
        to make amends. Meanwhile I ponder over your five wounds,
        dwelling on them with deep compassion and grief, and recalling
        the words that the prophet David wrote long ago, good Jesus, concerning yourself: They have pierced my hands and my feet; they
        have counted all my bones!
    </p>

    <hr/>

    <p>
        O Lord Jesus Christ, may your passion strengthen, protect
        and defend me. May your Wounds be my food and drink, which
        refresh me, inebriate me and fill me with joy. May the sprinkling of
        your Blood, wash me from all my sins. May your death be for me a
        source of inexhaustible life. May your Cross be my eternal glory.
        In all of this, may I find strengthening, joy, health and sweetness of
        heart. For you live and reign for ever and ever. Amen
    </p>

    <hr/>

    <p>
        O, Lord God, we pray, give the grace of perfect love to
        your servant. Through the merits of your passion, death and resurrection, through the intercession of the Mother of God, ever Virgin,
        preserve us, our loved ones, our families and benefactors and our
        home in the grace of sanctity. Dispel from us all evil.
    </p>

    <p>
        Never allow us to be overcome by temptation and rescue
        us from all dangers. Watch over the Church, our Order, our nation,
        our parents, friends and all who are in need of your mercy.
    </p>

    <p>
        Guard our Holy Father, all bishops of the world and especially our Father General. To all the faithful departed, grant eternal
        peace in your Kingdom. May we all praise you in heaven with
        your Son and our Lord, Jesus Christ, who lives and reigns with you
        in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. Amen.
    </p>

    <p>
        O, Lord Jesus Christ, Master of my life! Remove from
        me the spirit of laziness, depression and empty talkativeness.
        Grant to your servant a spirit of joy, peace, patience and love.
        Lord, allow me to see my sins and never judge my Brother. For
        you are blessed, for ever and ever. Amen.

    <h3>7.6.3 Prayer for humility
        <span>(composed by Mother Teresa of Calcutta)</span></h3>

<div class="indent">

    <div class="compact-paragraph">
        <p>O, Jesus, your heart was filled with silence and humility.
            I humbly bow before you with a true sorrow as I recognise the devastation caused by the pride of my heart.
        </p>
        <p>Lord, in your infinite mercy, give me the grace that I would not
            speak much about myself, but about your Gospel message, that I
            may not give in to curiosity and not overburden others with my
            problems or try to control their lives.
        </p>
        <p>Lord, Jesus, I am sorry if I ever have yielded to the temptation of sadness and self-pity, doubt or discouragement. I desire
            to accept with joy and even with humour all the contradictions of
            life, which I have to face day by day. I cannot pay much attention
            to the mistakes of others, but have to remember the fact that we are
            all weak.
        </p>
        <p>O, Jesus Christ, my Lord! You did not respond or defend
            yourself when you were falsely accused. Give me the ability to
            welcome bitter remarks, unjust and unfair accusations, offences
            and even insults, as if they were veritable pearls. May my will be
            free from personal, selfish stubbornness, and be willing to fulfil the
            wishes of others.
        </p>
        <p>In the past, I have been accepting of the praises of others and enjoyed being seen and acknowledged. O, my Master, help me from
            now on to see the light of holiness, often hidden in the shadow of
            humility and to cherish those moments of my life, marked with insolence, neglect, ignorance or ingratitude.
        </p>
        <p>O, my Lord! Up to now I have been kind towards people
            who love and respect me. Free me of this weakness and make me
            well-disposed toward all with kindness, meekness and generosity,
            especially towards those who are less lovable and ungrateful.
        </p>
        <p>O, Holy Spirit of truth and love! You imprint the image of Jesus in
            our souls. Bestow upon me the grace to fall in love with the modesty of my Saviour, Jesus Christ. He did not try to please the people with his glory or to impress them with his majesty and power.
            He took upon himself our human nature, which we have wounded
            by sin.
        </p>
        <p>I humbly ask you, inspire me with the longing to avoid
            everything that would inspire people to value me, to love me, to
            admire me or to follow me, because of my personality or achievements. May everything I do and talk about, inspire others to love
            more and more the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the Immaculate Heart
            of Mary.
        </p>
        <p>O Divine Master! You are the true friend of sinners, of
            tax-collectors, of abandoned and forgotten children, of lonely
            strangers, of broken hearts, and of all whose lives may be compared to a dimming lamp or a swaying reed.
        </p>
        <p>O, Divine Master! You hide your divine majesty under
            the veil of the suffering face of the Man of Sorrows! May I never
            abuse my human dignity or personal authority, to justify my decisions or actions. Instead, may I offer everything for your glory!
        </p>
        <p>For you live and reign for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
