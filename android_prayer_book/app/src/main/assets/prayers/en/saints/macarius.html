<h2><span class="rubric">Optional Memorial</span></h2>

<p><em>
    Macarius was born in Alexandria circa AD 300. In his youth, he went to the desert near Thebes,
    where he spent 29 years. Next, he moved to the Scetic Desert, where he gave himself to an even more
    rigorously penitential life. He was then ordained a priest. Living in prayer and fasting, he
    received the gift of prophecy as well the ability to work miracles.
