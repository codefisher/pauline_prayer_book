    A reading from the book of Ecclesiasticus
</div></div><p>
    The Lord honours the father in his children,
    and upholds the rights of a mother over her sons.
    Whoever respects his father is atoning for his sins,
    he who honours his mother is like someone amassing a fortune.
    Whoever respects his father will be happy with children of his own,
    he shall be heard on the day when he prays.
    Long life comes to him who honours his father,
    he who sets his mother at ease is showing obedience to the Lord.
    My son, support your father in his old age,
    do not grieve him during his life.
    Even if his mind should fail, show him sympathy,
    do not despise him in your health and strength;
    for kindness to a father shall not be forgotten
    but will serve as reparation for your sins.

    Do not let your love be a pretence, but sincerely prefer good to evil. Love each other as much as brothers should, and have a profound respect for each other. Work for the Lord with untiring effort and with great earnestness of spirit. If you have hope, this will make you cheerful. Do not give up if trials come; and keep on praying. If any of the saints are in need you must share with them; and you should make hospitality your special care.
</p>
<p>
    Bless those who persecute you: never curse them, bless them. Rejoice with those who rejoice and be sad with those in sorrow. Treat everyone with equal kindness; never be condescending but make real friends with the poor.

</div><p>
    Mary set out and went as quickly as she could to a town in the hill country of Judah. She went into Zechariah&#8217;s house and greeted Elizabeth. Now as soon as Elizabeth heard Mary&#8217;s greeting, the child leapt in her womb and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. She gave a loud cry and said, &#8216;Of all women you are the most blessed, and blessed is the fruit of your womb. Why should I be honoured with a visit from the mother of my Lord? For the moment your greeting reached my ears, the child in my womb leapt for joy. Yes, blessed is she who believed that the promise made her by the Lord would be fulfilled.&#8217;

    Mary said:

    Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months and then went back home.
