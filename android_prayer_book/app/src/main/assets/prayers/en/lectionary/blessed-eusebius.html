    I believe nothing can happen that will outweigh the supreme advantage of knowing Christ Jesus my
    Lord. For him I have accepted the loss of everything, and I look on everything as so much
    rubbish if only I can have Christ and be given a place in him. I am no longer trying for
    perfection by my own efforts, the perfection that comes from the Law, but I want only the
    perfection that comes through faith in Christ, and is from God and based on faith. All I want is
    to know Christ and the power of his resurrection and to share his sufferings by reproducing the
    pattern of his death. That is the way I can hope to take my place in the resurrection of the
    dead. Not that I have become perfect yet: I have not yet won, but I am still running, trying to
    capture the prize for which Christ Jesus captured me. I can assure you my brothers, I am far
    from thinking that I have already won. All I can say is that I forget the past and I strain
    ahead for what is still to come; I am racing for the finish, for the prize to which God calls us
    upwards to receive in Christ Jesus.

<div><div class="reading">Gospel</div><div class="ref">9:57-62</div><div>A reading from
    the holy Gospel according to Luke
</div><div class="rubric" style="text-align:center; font-size:0.8em;"><em>I will follow you wherever you go.</em></div></div><p>
    As Jesus and his disciples travelled along they met a man on the road who said to him, &#8216;I
    will follow you wherever you go.&#8217; Jesus answered, &#8216;Foxes have holes and the birds of
    the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.&#8217;
</p>
<p>
    Another to whom he said, &#8216;Follow me&#8217;, replied, &#8216;Let me go and bury my father
    first.&#8217; But he answered, &#8216;Leave the dead to bury their dead; your duty is to go and
    spread the news of the kingdom of God.&#8217;
</p>
<p>
    Another said, &#8216;I will follow you, sir, but first let me go and say goodbye to my people at
    home.&#8217; Jesus said to him, &#8216;Once the hand is laid on the plough, no one who looks
    back is fit for the kingdom of God.&#8217;
