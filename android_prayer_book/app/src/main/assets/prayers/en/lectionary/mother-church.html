    After Adam had eaten of the tree the Lord God called to him. &#8216;Where are you?&#8217; he asked. &#8216;I heard the sound of you in the garden;&#8217; he replied &#8216;I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid.&#8217; &#8216;Who told you that you were naked?&#8217; he asked &#8216;Have you been eating of the tree I forbade you to eat?&#8217; The man replied, &#8216;It was the woman you put with me; she gave me the fruit, and I ate it.&#8217; Then the Lord God asked the woman, &#8216;What is this you have done?&#8217; The woman replied, &#8216;The serpent tempted me and I ate.&#8217;
</p>
<p>
    Then the Lord God said to the serpent, &#8216;Because you have done this,
</p>
<p>
    &#8216;Be accursed beyond all cattle, <br/>
    all wild beasts. <br/>
    You shall crawl on your belly and eat dust <br/>
    every day of your life. <br/>
    I will make you enemies of each other: <br/>
    you and the woman, <br/>
    your offspring and her offspring. <br/>
    It will crush your head <br/>
    and you will strike its heel.&#8217;

    After Jesus was taken up into heaven the apostles went back from the Mount of Olives, as it is called, to Jerusalem, a short distance away, no more than a sabbath walk; and when they reached the city they went to the upper room where they were staying; there were Peter and John, James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot, and Jude son of James. All these joined in continuous prayer, together with several women, including Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.

    A reading from the holy Gospel according to John
</div><div class="rubric" style="text-align:center; font-size:0.8em;"><em>Behold your Son. Behold your Mother</em></div></div><p>
    Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother and his mother&#8217;s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary of Magdala. Seeing his mother and the disciple he loved standing near her, Jesus said to his mother, &#8216;Woman, this is your son.&#8217; Then to the disciple he said, &#8216;This is your mother.&#8217; And from that moment the disciple made a place for her in his home.
</p>
<p>
    After this, Jesus knew that everything had now been completed, and to fulfil the scripture perfectly he said, &#8216;I am thirsty.&#8217;
</p>
<p>
    A jar full of vinegar stood there, so putting a sponge soaked in the vinegar on a hyssop stick they held it up to his mouth. After Jesus had taken the vinegar he said, &#8216;It is accomplished&#8217;; and bowing his head he gave up his spirit.
</p>
<p>
    It was Preparation Day, and to prevent the bodies remaining on the cross during the sabbath &#8211; since that sabbath was a day of special solemnity &#8211; the Jews asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken away. Consequently the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with him and then of the other. When they came to Jesus, they found he was already dead, and so instead of breaking his legs one of the soldiers pierced his side with a lance; and immediately there came out blood and water.
