    The Lord created me when his purpose first unfolded,
    before the oldest of his works.
    From everlasting I was firmly set,
    from the beginning, before earth came into being.
    The deep was not, when I was born,
    there were no springs to gush with water.
    Before the mountains were settled,
    before the hills, I came to birth;
    before he made the earth, the countryside,
    or the first grains of the world's dust.
    When he fixed the heavens firm, I was there,
    when he drew a ring on the surface of the deep,
    when he thickened the clouds above,
    when he fixed fast the springs of the deep,
    when he assigned the sea its boundaries
    &#8212;and the waters will not invade the short&#8212;
    when he laid down the foundations of the earth,
    I was by his side, a master craftsman,
    delighting him day after day,
    ever at play in his presence,
    at play everywhere in his world,
    delighting to be with the sons of men.
</p>

<p>
    And now, my sons, listen to me;
    listen to instruction and learn to be wise,
    do not ignore it.
    Happy those who keep my ways!
    Happy the man who listens to me,
    who day after day watches at my gates
    to guard the portals.
    For the man who finds me finds life,
    he will win favor from the Lord.

In the days to come
the mountain of the Temple of the Lord
shall tower above the mountains
and be lifted higher than the hills.
All the nations will stream to it,
peoples without number will come to it; and they will say:
</p>
<blockquote>
&#8216;Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord,
to the Temple of the God of Jacob
that he may teach us his ways
so that we may walk in his paths;
since the Law will go out from Zion,
and the oracle of the Lord from Jerusalem.&#8217;
</blockquote>
<p>
He will wield authority over the nations
and adjudicate between many peoples;
these will hammer their swords into ploughshares,
their spears into sickles.
Nation will not lift sword against nation,
there will be no more training for war.
</p>
<p>
O House of Jacob, come,
let us walk in the light of the Lord.

    When the appointed time came, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born a subject of the Law, to
    redeem the subjects of the Law and to enable us to be adopted as sons. The proof that you are
    sons is that God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts: the Spirit that cries, &#8216;Abba,
    Father&#8217;, and it is this that makes you a son, you are not a slave any more; and if God has made
    you son, then he has made you heir.

    A reading from the holy Gospel according to John
</span></div><div class="rubric" style="text-align:center; font-size:0.8em;"><em>The mother of Jesus said to him, &#8216;They have no wine.&#8217; </em></div></div><p>
    There was a wedding at Cana in Galilee. The mother of Jesus was there, and Jesus and his
    disciples had also been invited. When they ran out of wine, since the wine provided for the
    wedding was all finished, the mother of Jesus said to him, &#8216;They have no wine.&#8217; Jesus said
    &#8216;Woman, why turn to me? My hour has not come yet.&#8217; His mother said to the servants, &#8216;Do whatever
    he tells you.&#8217; There were six stone water jars standing there, meant for the ablutions that are
    customary among the Jews: each could hold twenty or thirty gallons. Jesus said to the servants,
    &#8216;Fill the jars with water&#8217;, and they filled them to the brim. &#8216;Draw some out now&#8217; he told them
    &#8216;and take it to the steward.&#8217; They did this; the steward tasted the water, and it had turned
    into wine. Having no idea where it came from &#8211; only the servants who had drawn the water knew &#8211;
    the steward called the bridegroom and said, &#8216;People generally serve the best wine first, and
    keep the cheaper sort till the guests have had plenty to drink; but you have kept the best wine
    till now.&#8217;
</p>
<p>
    This was the first of the signs given by Jesus: it was given at Cana in Galilee. He let his
    glory be seen, and his disciples believed in him.
