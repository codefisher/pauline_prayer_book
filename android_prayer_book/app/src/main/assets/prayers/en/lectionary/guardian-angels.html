    The Lord says this: &#8216;I myself will send an angel before you to guard you as you go and to bring you to the place that I have prepared. Give him reverence and listen to all that he says. Offer him no defiance; he would not pardon such a fault, for my name is in him. If you listen carefully to his voice and do all that I say, I shall be enemy to your enemies, foe to your foes. My angel will go before you.&#8217;

    A reading from the holy Gospel according to Matthew
</div><div class="rubric" style="text-align:center; font-size:0.8em;"><em>Their angels in heaven are always in the presence of my Father, who is in heaven</em></div></div><p>
    The disciples came to Jesus and said, &#8216;Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?&#8217; So he
    called a little child to him and set the child in front of them. Then he said, &#8216;I tell you
    solemnly, unless you change and become like little children you will never enter the kingdom of
    heaven. And so, the one who makes himself as little as this little child is the greatest in the
    kingdom of heaven.
</p>

<p>
    &#8216;Anyone who welcomes a little child like this in my name welcomes me.
</p>

<p>
    &#8216;See that you never despise
    any of these little ones, for I tell you that their angels in heaven are continually in the
    presence of my Father in heaven.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
    The Gospel of the Lord.
