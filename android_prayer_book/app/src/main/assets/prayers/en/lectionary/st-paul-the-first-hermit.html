    The word of the Lord came to him, &#8216;Go away from here, go eastwards, and hide yourself in the
    wadi Cherith which lies east of Jordan. You can drink from the stream, and I have ordered the
    ravens to bring you food there.&#8217; He did as the Lord had said; he went and stayed in the wadi
    Cherith which lies east of Jordan. The ravens brought him bread in the morning and meat in the
    evening, and he quenched his thirst at the stream.

    to the Galatians
</div><div class="rubric" style="text-align:center; font-size:0.8em;"><em>I live now, not I but Christ lives in me</em></div></div><p>
    Through the Law I am dead to the Law, so that now I can live for God. I have been crucified with
    Christ, and I live now not with my own life but with the life of Christ who lives in me. The
    life I now live in this body I live in faith: faith in the Son of God who loved me and who
    sacrificed himself for my sake.
</p>

<p>
    You cannot belong to Christ Jesus unless you crucify all self-indulgent passions and desires.
</p>

<p>
    Since the Spirit is our life, let us be directed by the Spirit.
</p>

<p>
    As for me, the only thing I can boast about is the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ,
    through whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world. It does not matter if a person
    is circumcised or not; what matters is for him to become an altogether new creature.
    Peace and mercy to all who follow this rule, who form the Israel of God.
</p>

<p>
    I want no more trouble from anybody after this: the marks on my body are those of Jesus.
</p>

<p>
    The Word of the Lord.

    A reading from
    the holy Gospel according to Matthew
</div><div class="rubric" style="text-align:center; font-size:0.8em;"><em>You have hidden these things from the learned and the clever and revealed them to children</em></div></div><p>
    Jesus exclaimed, &#8216;I bless you, Father, Lord of heaven and of earth, for hiding these things from
    the learned and the clever and revealing them to mere children. Yes, Father, for that is what it
    pleased you to do. Everything has been entrusted to me by my Father; and no one knows the Son
    except the Father, just as no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son
    chooses to reveal him.
</p>
<p>
    &#8216;Come to me, all you who labour and are overburdened, and I will give you rest. Shoulder my yoke
    and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
    Yes, my yoke is easy and my burden light.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
    The Gospel of the Lord.
