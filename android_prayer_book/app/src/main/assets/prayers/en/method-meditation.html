<h1 class="section">B. Meditation</h1>


<p>The Pauline spirituality enrichens itself with the unceasing, centuries old, varieties of forms
    of prayer. However above all we need to choose the <em>optiamam patrem</em> (the better part) of
    Mary the sister of Lazarus and Martha, which is meditation, the beginning of the spiritual life.
    Not without the spice of attic salt, did Fr Andrew Eggerer OSPPE write about our
    semi-contemplative life, in his first volume of his Pauline annals, published in the year
    1663: &#8220;so too did our fathers in the hermitages and then in the cenobiums of Hungary. Thus
    fulfilling the service of the busy Martha, at the same time they did not cease abiding with
    Magdalen at the feet of Jesus, giving themselves over to the contemplation of heavenly things.
    Let them remember of how they ought not to imitate those who today in monasteries live only for
    their stomachs, complaining about the yoke of the work of their own hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>Quite so, in those now distant years, the discerned inspiration of the Holy Spirit, found its
    place in our spirituality of meditations, which although it is a passive prayer, beginning in
    secret, bears its results visibly not only in the whole life of the monk, but also in the Order
    and finally in the Church. The almighty is a hidden God, and His Son led a hidden life for many
    years, only to shine later in the preaching of the Gospel and the numerous miracles which
    finally shone forth in his conquering of death, and in his resurrection. </p>

<p>Consecrated persons, likewise, experience an incomparable role in the hidden life of Jesus, in
    which they practice prayer, which is not for show, but seeks the closed doors of the cell in
    which God sees that which is hidden and repays that which we cannot fully express (cf. Mt 6:6).
    In the decree <em>Perfectae Caritatis, </em>that is the decree on the adaptation and the renewal
    of Religious life, in paragraph 6, we read:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>6. Let those who make profession of the evangelical counsels seek and love above all else God
        who has first loved us (cf. 1 John 4:10) and let them strive to foster in all circumstances
        a life hidden with Christ in God (cf. Col. 3:3). This love of God both excites and energizes
        that love of one's neighbour which contributes to the salvation of the world and the
        building up of the Church. This love, in addition, quickens and directs the actual practice
        of the evangelical counsels.</p>

    <p>Drawing therefore upon the authentic sources of Christian spirituality, members of religious
        communities should resolutely cultivate both the spirit and practice of prayer. In the first
        place they should have recourse daily to the Holy Scriptures in order that, by reading and
        meditating on Holy Writ, they may learn &#8220;the surpassing worth of knowing Jesus Christ&#8221;
        (Phil. 3:8). They should celebrate the sacred liturgy, especially the holy sacrifice of the
        Mass, with both lips and heart as the Church desires and so nourish their spiritual life
        from this richest of sources.</p>

    <p>So refreshed at the table of divine law and the sacred altar of God, they will love Christ's
        members as brothers, honour and love their pastors as sons should do, and living and
        thinking ever more in union with the Church, dedicate themselves wholly to its mission.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The conciliar decree explains the manner of life of consecrated persons and defines them, as
    hidden in Christ, the foundations of such an approach we see in the every-day immersion in the
    Sacred Scriptures. Twice appears the phrase, &#8220;above all&#8221;, highlighting the priority
    of this practice, which forms our order&#8217;s identity: above all prayer, and first prayer
    amongst prayers, the seeking of Christ in the Sacred Scriptures! Secondly, the Council draws
    attention to the tight link between meditation and preaching with the Eucharist. To learn about
    Christ not only out of sheer curiosity or out of intellectual endeavour, but solely to create a
    relationship of Love, of friendship, which will always deepen, which will not cease but will
    overflow onto the People of God. This is the fundamental vocation of every consecrated person.
    For this to happen, meditation of the Word of God, must have a privileged place in our Monastic
    society. </p>

<p>St Thomas Aquinas in his famous <em>Summa Theologiae</em>, wrote: <em>necessaria est iugis
    oratio</em> &#8212; the yoke of prayer is necessary &#8212; everyday, like in a yoke we ought to
    meditate, because a repeated habitual action, not episodic, lastingly changes a man. A monk
    without meditation is like a mindless person, capable only of unsettling himself and others with
    egocentric ambitions or fears. Jesus in every spare moment, utilised His time in meditation. He
    had the ethos of reading the scrolls of the Torah and personal prayer in mediation, of which
    writes the evangelist Luke, whilst speaking of the habits of Jesus, that his is an unchanging
    practice of prayer (cf. Lk 4:16-17; 22:39-40).</p>

<p>The ethos of a monk ought to be the same as the practice of Jesus. &#917;&#964;&#959;&#962;
    in Greek is the same as our word &#8220;habit,&#8221; that is; a permanent disposition towards
    action, the practice of a particular thing or expressing it in the light of the gospel, a sweet
    yoke and a light burden. Although giving time every day to mediation may seem like a burden for
    our bodies, nevertheless it makes our lives spiritually light. It should become our saving
    passion, because only passion protects us from damming addictions. The habit of prayer and
    meditation on the Word of God, not only protects us against addictions, but also opens heaven to
    us, because it is exactly that, a new plain of existence, knowing that the one we were born into
    will suffer destruction (cf. Lk 3:21). The passion of meditation contains strength surpassing
    all human obsessions and opens him to a higher level of existence, that is the sharing in the
    very life of God. St John Chrysostom believed that no one could remain in sin, who ceaselessly
    harnesses himself in the yoke of prayer and meditation on the Scriptures. In our newest Pauline
    constitutions, article 27 speaks of Sacred Scripture as the source of our meditation, which we
    must cultivate, whole heartedly in our everyday lives, for it is the fundamental method of
    dialogue with God and directs us towards Mary, who from her earliest earthly years, kept and
    meditated in her heart His Words. </p>

<p>An exceptional distinction for the order was the arrival, at a particular time, of the miraculous
    icon of Jasna G&#243;ra into the heart of our order, as well as the discernment of the
    movement of the Holy Spirit directing our community to care for the People of God,
    particularly those in marian shrines. She herself, even before she became the Mother of God, the
    Virgin listening and meditating, directs the Paulines. It does not behove us to omit the central
    detail of the architecture of the church that puts before us the pattern of imitating her, and
    thus in such a way, like her, to accept and come to know Jesus Christ. </p>

<p>The Mother of Jesus is a model of faith, because she is unmatched in the listening to and
    meditating on the mysteries of the Word of God. The freedom of God and the freedom of man meet
    uniquely in meditation, opening forth the event of the annunciation in Nazareth. God turns to
    man with the Word saturated with Life, for life is most radically attributed to God, whereby the
    reception of Him is very much similar to conception. The Synoptic Evangelists recall the visit
    of the relatives of Jesus, who standing outside a house in which He was teaching, sought to meet
    with Him. Then He said these words, which for many seem troublesome, when at the same time they
    are an invitation to accept with a discerning heart His words and thanks to them fulfil the
    will of God: &#8220;My mother and My brothers are those who, hear the word of God and keep it.&#8221;
    (cf. Lk 8:21).</p>

<p>Adrienne von Speyr interpreted this response of Jesus, as a renunciation of the rights of
    Motherhood in regards to the Son of God in favour of all who like Mary whole-heartedly nourish
    themselves on His Words. St Augustine in his homily on the Birth of Christ, said, &#8220;The
    Mother who carried Him in her womb, we carry also in our hearts (&#8230;) Let us not be
    infertile &#8211; let our hearts be fertile in God.&#8221; St Ambrose similarly courageously
    commented on this mysterious response of Jesus: &#8220;He fulfilled the will of the Father, that
    you would become the Mother of Christ.&#8221; Because our thoughts are not His thoughts (Is
    55:8), it is vitally important to devote time to meditation, so that the words of God read in
    the Bible become incarnate in the received experience of the Monk. So that he may become ever
    more similar to the Mother of the Saviour, just as it took place in the life of Mary, in whom
    the Word became flesh, and the thoughts of her meditated prayers were fulfilled in the events of
    her fate. </p>

<p>It is not by accident, that just as the landmark events for a Pauline, the clothing in the habit
    and Solemn Vows take place on Solemnities on which the church reads the gospel pericope of the
    annunciation (8 XII ad 25 III). A radical otherness of the Word of God to the human intellect
    always causes the monk to firstly purify his thoughts and quieten his interior before beginning
    to meditate. Fr Gregory Terecy, (+1660) in his <em>Conversio morum Paulinorum, </em>recommends
    that in preparation for meditation, the monk casts far away from himself all useless
    thoughts, phantasms, memories and all connotations bounded up with human aspirations and fears,
    which depart from the subject of the meditation. Thus meditation for the Pauline is a personal
    incarnation &#8211; thanks to this personal prayer, the presence of the Holy Spirit makes our
    consecrated lives really spiritual, not only by profession, but also by practice. Meditation
    upon the Word of God fully develops faith, creating the best environment for the living out of
    the Eucharist, as the source of our saving life in a vivacious, conscious and loving way. In the
    Pauline constitutions from the year 1930 we find more than an encouragement not to omit
    meditation, but we also find the Prior being obligated to whole heartedly care for the meditations
    of the monks entrusted to his care. For as we read in chapter XII &#8220;Our Order, thanks to
    holy meditation and contemplation was once flourishing.&#8221;(68) Certainly the roots of such
    an obligation to meditation reach to the constitution from the year 1644, where in article 10, we
    can read even stronger words, where the growth of our order is dependent on this very form of
    prayer. A Pauline, even if he could not participate in the communal morning meditation or the
    evening one, then he is obliged to fulfil personally his mediation, even if he must give up his
    free time to do so. The Sub-prior was even obliged to question the monks on the effects of their
    meditations. The care then for this prayer, through the ages, was regarded as the foundation of
    the very life and strength of the order itself. Likewise, every fall in the spiritual life
    always began with a falling away from this sublime form of prayer. In the Rule of Bartholomew of
    the five churches, from the year 1215, dedicated to the Hermits of Patacs, meditation and prayer
    took first place among the many activities of the monks. </p>

<p>The Monks of Jasna G&#243;ra in the XVII century rose at midnight, so that after Matins, they
    could do half an hour of meditation. This is written in the manuscripts of Jasna G&#243;ra and
    it convinces us that among the forms of prayer, the Paulines gave great weight to this form.
    This was not a meditation removed from their lives nor from the Bible, drifting into ideal and
    theoretical subjects, because the Pauline <em>Liber Meditationis,</em> (1630) proposes
    meditation under its first section, entitled: <em>De magnitudine malitiae peccati &#8211; </em>Concerning
    the great malice of Sin. During the expanse of the centuries, the methods of mental prayer were
    greatly influenced by Carmelite and Jesuit currents; nevertheless, they were inclined to follow
    the exhortations of the previous council, encouraging the practice of <em>lectio divina. </em>It
    is necessary to underline that the method used by every community and each one of us is adapted
    to our spiritual characters, modifying and making them more vivacious and robust to use. </p>

<p>At the source of <em>lectio divina </em>lies the method that was systemised by the Cathurisan
    Guido II, the Angelic (+1188) in his <em>opusculum</em> entitled <em>Scala Claustralium:
        LECTIO</em> (reading) <em>MEDITATIO</em> (meditation), <em>ORATIO</em> (prayer), <em>CONTEMPLATIO</em>
    (contemplation). Due to Pauline Spirituality not being limited to the work of contemplation but
    likewise ordered towards the apostolic work, shares its own won spiritual treasures, through
    working in the confessional, through preaching, through retreats, days of recollection and
    through spiritual direction. We can confidently adapt the Carthusian method to our spiritual
    needs with one additional point: <em>PRONUNTIATIO</em> (Proclamation) in accordance with the
    words of Our Lord: &#8220;What I tell you in the dark, utter in the light; and what you hear
    whispered, proclaim upon the housetops.&#8221; (Mt 10:27).</p>

<p>The mother of our redeemer did likewise when after Gabriel&#8217;s annunciation, addressed to her
    in the darkness of meditation, left for the far away land of Ajn Karim. Then under the roof
    of the house of Elizabeth she could fulfil the hymn, which every day in vespers reminds us of
    the necessity of the transmission of the faith to others. In connection with this, it behoves
    us, not to treat our meditation solely as some private prayer, rather as a preparation for a
    homily, recollection or some other form of evangelisation. Every page of sacred scripture is
    like a well, from which we need to draw water, to quench the soul&#8217;s thirst for the Holy
    Spirit, just as the Samaritan widow at Sychar was thirsty for Love. Because nothing encourages
    more than an example, let us offer a short example of meditation, to illustrate its process. Due
    to many of us using readings from the Liturgy for mediation, it is good to remember that the
    liturgical readings do not contain the entirety of the Sacred Scriptures. </p>
