<h1>9. Prayer to the Queen of Hermits for our Order
</h1>

<p>
    Our Lady of Jasna Gora, Mother of the Church, singular
    Patroness of the Pauline Order and Queen of Hermits! We
    wish to express our eager thanksgiving for your blessed presence in
    our Religious Family. Be ever honoured for being our unfailing
    Hope and Refuge in the history of the Order, especially in its most
    difficult moments. Along with you, we praise the Divine Providence, which has entrusted to us many new places for our apostolic
    works and the establishment of shrines, particularly that of Jasna
    Gora, as the primary centre of your glory and our Pauline service.
</p>

<p>
    We want to serve you in the Church and our Nation worthily, especially at the shrine of Jasna Gora, where Almighty God
    has deigned to glorify your miraculous Image with a rare devotion
    of the faithful. We thank you for your maternal goodness demonstrated in the past, and we ask you today to continue to shower
    upon us all the graces we need.
</p>

<p>
    Through your maternal presence, make our consciences
    sensitive so that we may repent of the sins of our past, and help us to
    make good resolutions for the future.
</p>

<p>
    O Mother, forgive us our negligence in imitating your
    virtues and our shortcomings in fostering your glory among people.
</p>

<p>
    O Mother, forgive us our unwillingness to entrust ourselves completely to you, without any hesitation.
</p>

<p>
    O Mother, forgive us our weaknesses and defects in straying
    from the ways of those who are &#8220;totally consecrated to you&#8221;.
</p>

<p>
    O Humble Servant of the Lord! Teach us to know Jesus
    more deeply! Help us to become a &#8220;new creation&#8221;, by being faithful to our religious vows and to the spiritual heritage of our Fathers. Help us to build up our fraternal Community in our Religious Houses, by our mutual love, respect and trust. United with
    our Superiors, may we radiate the light of the Gospel!
</p>

<p>
    O Mother of the Church! Animate us in apostolic zeal! Inspire us
    with new pastoral initiatives and teach us to join contemplation
    with evangelization, that we may serve the faithful well in their
    struggles to enrich their life of faith with greater efficacy.
</p>

<p>
    Finally, O Teacher of many Pauline generations! Ask your Son,
    the Lord of the Harvest, to send new hosts of workers for service in
    our Order. May our Novitiates and Seminaries be your
    schools of Religious and Priestly life. May there be a new Pentecost within our Monastic Family to the glory of the Most Holy
    Trinity and the joy of the People of God. Amen.
</p>
