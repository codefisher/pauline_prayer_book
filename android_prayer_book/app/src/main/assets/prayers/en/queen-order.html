<p>
    O Holy Mary, Mother of God, ever Virgin! I Brother
    <span class="rubric">N. N.</span> choose you this day for my Mother, Queen and
    Protectress. I resolve never to abandon you, and I promise to work
    with every thought, word and action to further your glory. I beg

    not forsake me at the hour of my death. Amen.
