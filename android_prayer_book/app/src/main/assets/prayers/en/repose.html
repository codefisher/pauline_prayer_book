<h1>6. Prayer Before Repose</h1>

<div class="indent">

    <p class="instruction">
        Before we retire, following our custom, we are to pray in
        our private room, on our knees with hands raised in the form of the
        cross, while reciting three times, the &#8220;Hail Mary&#8221;. After each &#8220;Hail
        Mary&#8221; we are to repeat the following invocation to the Most Holy Virgin
        Mary:
    </p>

    <p>
        Through your Holy and Immaculate Conception, O
        Most Holy Virgin Mary, make my heart pure and my soul
        holy.
    </p>

    <p class="instruction">
        Then to honour St. Paul we pray this additional prayer
    </p>

    <p>
        O Lord God Almighty, who deigned to detach St.
        Paul the First Hermit from the noisy world and in an admirable way joined him to the Angelic choirs, I ask you to purify
        me of all earthly profanity and permeate me with heavenly
        gifts. Through Christ, Our Lord. Amen.
    </p>
