    Introduction to the blessing of children:
</p>

<p>
        Lord Jesus Christ, when children were brought to you, you took them into your arms, and laid
        your hands on them, and blessed them, and said: &#8220;Suffer the little children to come to me,
        and forbid them not; for such is the kingdom of heaven; and their Angels stand before my
        Father and see Him face to face.&#8221; Through the intercession of St. Paul the First Hermit, let
        us pray for God&#8217;s blessing for these children, that he might surround them with his loving
        care.

        Loving God, though the meditation of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the Holy Guardian Angels and
        St. Paul the First Hermit, we ask you to send upon these children gathered here your
        Blessing, <span class="cross">&#9769;</span> may they constantly experience your loving care and
        protection. As they mature,
        may they always carry out your holy will, may they approach you with respectful fear, and
        keep your commandments: so that they may accomplish good works among your people, be
        obedient to the inspirations of the Holy Spirit and thus be witnesses, proclaimers and
        defenders of the faith. Through Christ our Lord.

        Lord, our God, out of the speech of little children you have fashioned a hymn of praise.
        Look with kindness on these children whom the faith of the Church commends to your tender
        care. Your Son, born of the Virgin Mary, gladly welcomed little children. He took them in
        his arms, blessed them, and held them up as an example for all. We pray through the
        intercession of Saint Paul the First Hermit that you, Father, will also send your blessing
        on them, so that they may grow in Christian maturity and, by the power of the Holy Spirit,
        become Christ's witnesses in the world, spreading and defending the faith. Through Christ
        our Lord.
