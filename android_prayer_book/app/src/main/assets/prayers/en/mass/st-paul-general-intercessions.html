<div><div class="reading">Introduction</div></div><p>
    My brothers and sisters, as we joyfully celebrate the
    feast of St Paul the First Hermit, we turn our hearts to God the Father and ask him to pour out
    abundant graces on the Church and the world from the treasury of Christ&#8217;s love.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>For our Holy Father, our bishops and priests, and all the leaders of the church, that they
        may attain sanctity and be perfectly conformed to our Lord Jesus Christ.
        <br/>Let us pray to the Lord.
    </li>

    <li>For the Pauline Fathers and Brothers who generously follow St. Paul&#8217;s way of life, that they
        may be endowed with wisdom and brought to perfection in the Lord Jesus.
        <br/>Let us pray to the Lord.
    </li>

    <li>For vocations to the Pauline Order; that many young men may take on the challenge of priestly
        ministry and religious life, and that the Lord of the harvest may send out more labourers
        into the harvest.
        <br/>Let us pray to the Lord.
    </li>
    <li>For all who are in need of special prayer today, especially the confraters and benefactors
        of the Pauline Order, that through the intercession of St. Paul the First Hermit they
        may dwell in the shelter of the Most High and find refuge beneath His wings.
        <br/>Let us pray to the Lord.
    </li>
    <li>For all of us who participate in this Holy Sacrifice, that we who receive the source of
        wisdom in Jesus may be wise and loving in our dealings with one another.
        <br/>Let us pray to the Lord.
    </li>
    <li>For all our departed loved ones, especially the Pauline Fathers and Brothers, that they may
        see the heavens opened and the angels of God descending to carry them up to the Son of God.
        <br/>Let us pray to the Lord.
    </li>
</ol>

<div><div class="reading">Conclusion</div></div><p>
    O God, our heavenly Father, you have given St. Paul
    the First Hermit to us as a model of trust in you. We ask you to listen to our prayers and
    to assist us in our needs. Grant that we may find happiness in devoting ourselves to your
    service and that of the Church, and may one day, with Mary and all the saints, rejoice in
    the kingdom of heaven where you live for ever and ever. <br/> Amen.

<div><div class="reading">Introduction</div></div><p>On this Solemnity of Saint Paul the First Hermit, a man of God and a man of prayer, let us rise
    to pray for the Church and the world through the merits of his life.</p>

<ol>
    <li> Let us pray for the people of God throughout the world: that, through the prayer of Saint
        Paul, they may always think with the Church and grow in love of the faith.
        <br/>Let us pray to the Lord.
    </li>
    <li>Let us ask God&#8217;s help for all who pray: that their words may be in harmony with their
        actions, their lips with their hearts, and their lives with their petitions.
        <br/>Let us pray to the Lord.
    </li>
    <li>Let us pray for all the Pauline monks: that they may be renewed in their zeal for the
        kingdom of God and may be generous in the service of faith and justice.
        <br/>Let us pray to the Lord.
    </li>
    <li>Let us pray for all young people: that they may come to know and love their Lord and Saviour
        and not be deaf to the call which he gives.
        <br/>Let us pray to the Lord.
    </li>
    <li>Let us pray for all within this community: that, following the example of Saint Paul, they
        may seek God in all things and be blessed by the gift of prayer, and that they may grow in
        their love of the Mass and the Blessed Sacrament.
        <br/>Let us pray to the Lord.
    </li>
    <li>Let us pray for all deceased members and friends of the Pauline Order, and for all the
        Faithful departed: that they may with St Paul and all the Angels and Saints enjoy the vision
        of God&#8217;s glory in heaven.
        <br/>Let us pray to the Lord.
    </li>
</ol>

<div><div class="reading">Conclusion</div></div><p>Almighty God and Father, listen, we beseech you, to the prayers of your people, and the merits of
