<h2><span class="rubric">Memorial</span></h2>

<p><em>
    Pachomius was an Egyptian Monk, the writer of the first rule of religious life and of
    coenobitism. He was born around 287AD in Egypt. In his youth he was recruited into the Roman
    Army. During his service, under the influence of the selfless help of Christians, he converted
    to the faith. He resolved to give himself to the exclusive service of God. He went into the
    Desert, where he lived in austere asceticism under the guidance of St Palemon, following which
    he lived a life of solitude in Tabenna, where he himself founded a monastic community.
