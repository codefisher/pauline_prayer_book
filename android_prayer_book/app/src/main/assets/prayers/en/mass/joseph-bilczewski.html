<h2><span class="rubric">Optional Memorial</span></h2>

<p><em>
    Joseph Bilczewski was born on the 26th of April 1860 in Wilamowice near K&#281;ty. He was the
    Archbishop of Lviv, the professor of Dogmatic Theology and the Rector of the Lviv University.
    He had great devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary, Queen of Poland. He believed her cult to be
    the greatest cause in the unification and rebirth of the Polish nation in the years of the
    Partitions of Poland.
