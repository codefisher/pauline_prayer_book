<h2><span class="rubric">Optional Memorial</span></h2>

<p><em>
    Joseph Bilczewski was born on the 26th of April 1860 in Wilamowice near K&#281;ty. He was the
    Archbishop of L&#8217;viv, the professor of Dogmatic Theology and the Rector of the L&#8217;viv University.
    He had great devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary, Queen of Poland. He believed her cult to be
    the greatest cause in the unification and re-birth of the Polish nation in the years of the
    Partitions of Poland.
