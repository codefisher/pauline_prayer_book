<p><em>
    Tecla is thought to have come from Iconium. She was said to have received Baptism from St Paul
    the Apostle during his first journey through Asia Minor (the years 45-49). She made a vow of
    Chasity and remained unmarried. She accompanied St Paul in his journeys, ministering to him. She
    is supposedly to have lived long life, well into her 80s, of which she spent a significant
    amount as a hermit.
