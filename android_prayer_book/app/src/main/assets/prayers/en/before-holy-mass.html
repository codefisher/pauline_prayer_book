    <h2 id="41-prayer-of-st-ambrose">4.1 Prayer of St. Ambrose</h2>

    <p>
        I draw near, loving Lord Jesus Christ,
        to the table of your most delightful banquet
        in fear and trembling,
        a sinner, presuming not upon my own merits,
        but trusting rather in your goodness and mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have a heart and body defiled by my many offenses,
        a mind and tongue
        over which I have kept no good watch.
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, O loving God, O awesome Majesty,
        I turn in my misery, caught in snares,
        to you the fountain of mercy,
        hastening to you for healing,
        flying to you for protection;
        and while I do not look forward to having you as Judge,
        I long to have you as Savior.
    </p>
    <p>
        To you, O Lord, I display my wounds,
        to you I uncover my shame.
        I am aware of my many and great sins,
        for which I fear,
        but I hope in your mercies,
        which are without number.
    </p>
    <p>
        Look upon me, then, with eyes of mercy,
        Lord Jesus Christ, eternal King,
        God and Man, crucified for mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
        Listen to me, as I place my hope in you,
        have pity on me, full of miseries and sins,
        you, who will never cease
        to let the fountain of compassion flow.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hail, O Saving Victim,
        offered for me and for the whole human race
        on the wood of the Cross.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hail, O noble and precious Blood,
        flowing from the wounds
        of Jesus Christ, my crucified Lord,
        and washing away the sins of all the world.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remember, Lord, your creature,
        whom you redeemed by your Blood.
        I am repentant of my sins,
        I desire to put right what I have done.
    </p>
    <p>
        Take from me, therefore, most merciful Father,
        all my iniquities and sins,
        so that, purified in mind and body,
        I may worthily taste the Holy of Holies.
    </p>
    <p>
        And grant that this sacred foretaste
        of your Body and Blood
        which I, though unworthy, intend to receive,
        may be the remission of my sins,
        the perfect cleansing of my faults,
        the banishment of shameful thoughts,
        and the rebirth of right sentiments;
        and may it encourage
        a wholesome and effective performance
        of deeds pleasing to you
        and be a most firm defense of body and soul
        against the snares of my enemies.
        Amen.
    </p>

    <h2 id="42-prayer-of-st-thomas-aquinas">4.2 Prayer of St. Thomas Aquinas</h2>

    <p>
        Almighty eternal God,
        behold, I come to the Sacrament
        of your Only Begotten Son,
        our Lord Jesus Christ,
        as one sick to the physician of life,
        as one unclean to the fountain of mercy,
        as one blind to the light of eternal brightness,
        as one poor and needy to the Lord of heaven and earth.
    </p>
    <p>
        I ask, therefore, for the abundance of your immense
        generosity,
        that you may graciously cure my sickness,
        wash away my defilement,
        give light to my blindness,
        enrich my poverty,
        clothe my nakedness,
        so that I may receive the bread of Angels,
        the King of kings and Lord of lords,
        with such reverence and humility,
        such contrition and devotion,
        such purity and faith,
        such purpose and intention
        as are conducive to the salvation of my soul.
    </p>
    <p>
        Grant, I pray, that I may receive
        not only the Sacrament of the Lord&#8217;s Body and Blood,
        but also the reality and power of that Sacrament.
        O most gentle God,
        grant that I may so receive
        the Body of your Only Begotten Son our Lord Jesus Christ,
        which he took from the Virgin Mary,
        that I may be made worthy
        to be incorporated into his Mystical Body
        and to be counted among its members.
    </p>
    <p>
        O most loving Father,
        grant that I may at last gaze for ever
        upon the unveiled face of your beloved Son,
        whom I, a wayfarer,
        propose to receive now veiled under these species:
        Who lives and reigns with you for ever and ever.
        Amen.
    </p>

    <h2 id="43-prayer-to-our-lady">4.3 Prayer to Our Lady</h2>

    <p>
        O most blessed Virgin Mary,
        Mother of tenderness and mercy,
        I, a miserable and unworthy sinner,
        fly to you with all the affection of my heart
        and I beseech your motherly love,
        that, as you stood by your most dear Son,
        while he hung on the Cross,
        so, in your kindness,
        you may be pleased to stand by me, a poor sinner,
        and all Priests who today are offering the Sacrifice
        here and throughout the entire holy Church,
        so that with your gracious help
        we may offer a worthy and acceptable oblation
        in the sight of the most high and undivided Trinity.
        Amen.
    </p>

    <h2 id="44-the-priests-declaration-of-purpose-before-mass">4.4 The Priest&#8217;s Declaration of Purpose before Mass</h2>

    <p>
        My intention is to celebrate Mass
        and to consecrate the Body and Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ
        according to the Rite of Holy Roman Church,
        to the praise of almighty God
        and all the Church triumphant,
        for my good
        and that of all the Church militant,
        for all who have commended themselves to my prayers
        in general and in particular,
        and for the welfare of Holy Roman Church.
        Amen.
    </p>
    <p>
        May the almighty and merciful Lord
        grant us joy with peace,
        amendment of life,
        room for true repentance,
        the grace and consolation of the Holy Spirit
        and perseverance in good works.
        Amen.
    </p>

    <h2 id="45-prayer-from-the-preface-ii-of-the-holy-eucharist">4.5 Prayer from the Preface II of the Holy Eucharist</h2>

    <p>
        It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,
        always and everywhere to give you thanks,
        Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God,
        through Christ our Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
        For at the last Supper with his Apostles,
        establishing for the ages to come
            the saving memorial of the Cross,
        he offered himself to you as the unblemished Lamb,
        the acceptable gift of perfect praise.
    </p>
    <p>
        Nourishing your faithful by this sacred mystery,
        you make them holy, so that the human race,
        bounded by one word,
        may be enlightened by one faith
        and united by one bond of charity.
    </p>

    <p>
        And so, we approach the table of
            this wondrous Sacrament,
        so that, bathed in the sweetness of your grace,
        we may pass over to the heavenly realities
            here foreshadowed.
    </p>

    <h2 id="46-prayer-to-st-joseph">4.6 Prayer to St. Joseph</h2>

    <p>
        God, who has conferred upon us a royal priesthood, we
        pray to you give us grace to minister at your holy altar with hearts
        as clean and lives as blameless as that of blessed Joseph, who was
        found worthy to hold in his arms and, with all reverence, to carry
        you the only-begotten Son, born of the Virgin Mary. Enable us this
        day to receive worthily the sacred Body and Blood of your Son,
        and enable us to win an everlasting reward in the world to come;
        through the same Christ our Lord. Amen.
