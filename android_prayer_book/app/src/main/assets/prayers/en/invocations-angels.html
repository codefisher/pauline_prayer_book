<h1 class="section">D. Joined to the Guardian Angels</h1>

<p class="instruction">
    &#8220;Consequently, over and above our Marian devotion, we
    should take care especially to foster devotion to the Holy Angels&#8221; (<a href="constitutions/life-community-in-god.html#art32" ebook="ebook">art. 32</a>). The Pauline tradition and the faith teach us, that
    liturgy and prayer is a work of the whole Church; both of
    the pilgrim Church on earth and of the glorious one in heaven. In
    the Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy of the Second Vatican Council, we read: &#8220;In the earthly liturgy we take part in a foretaste of
    that heavenly liturgy&#8230;with the Heavenly Hosts, we sing a hymn of
    glory to the Lord&#8221; (Sacrosanctum Concilium 8).
</p>

<p class="instruction">
    By honouring our Holy Angels, we want to bring our daily
    life ever closer to the Kingdom of God. Let us keep in mind that
    the primary obligation of Angels is to worship God. The liturgical
    texts constantly remind us of this. We are also encouraged to follow the Holy Angels in our worship and praise of God. We do not
    add anything to God&#8217;s glory. Our praise and worship of God, contribute to our salvation.

<h2>Prayer to the Angels</h2>

<div class="indent compact-paragraph">

    <p>
        Holy choirs of Angels! You were the first from among all
        creatures to recognize the supreme authority of God over you, pay
        him homage and adore him; teach us to humble ourselves before
        God&#8217;s majesty.
    </p>
    <p>
        Holy servants of the Lord! You always stand before the
        throne of God, ready to obey his commands; teach us to remain
        faithful in fulfilling God&#8217;s holy will.
    </p>
    <p>
        St. Michael the Archangel, prince of the heavenly hosts,
        who with the cry &#8220;Who is like God&#8221; defeated Lucifer and his angels;
        inspire us with a zeal to work for the greater glory of God.
    </p>
    <p>
        St. Gabriel the Archangel, who announced to the Holy
        Virgin Mary that she would become the Mother of the Son of God by
        the power of the Holy Spirit; illuminate our minds, that like Mary,
        we may accept all revealed truths of God with a deep humility.
    </p>
    <p>
        St. Raphael the Archangel, who happily guided Tobias
        and protected him against an evil spirit; be our companion on our
        earthly pilgrimage to the heavenly homeland.
    </p>
    <p>
        Holy Angels, who unceasingly contemplate the face of the
        heavenly Father; teach us to see God and his perfection everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
        Holy Angels, who sang the glory of God and announced
        his peace to the people of good will at the birth of Jesus; bring
        the peace of Christ to our hearts.
    </p>
    <p>
        Holy Angels, in whose company, Christ will come to
        judge the living and the dead; lead us on the way to salvation.
    </p>

    <p>
        Holy Angels, who stand before the throne of God; present
        to him our prayers and deeds, that he may kindly accept them, forgive all our sins and grant us the grace to join you in heaven forever and ever. Amen.
    </p>
