<h1>2. Prayer of St. Bernard (The Memorare)</h1>

<p class="indent">
Remember, O Most Gracious Virgin Mary, that never was
it known in any age that anyone who fled to your protection, implored your help or sought your intercession, was left unaided.
Inspired with this confidence, I fly unto you, O Virgin of virgins,
my Mother. To you I come, before you I stand, sinful and sorrowful. O Mother of the Word Incarnate, do not despise my petitions,
but in your mercy, hear and answer me. Amen.
</p>
