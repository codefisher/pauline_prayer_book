<h1>2. Prayer of St. Bernard <span>(The Memorare)</span></h1>

<p class="indent">
    Remember, O most gracious Virgin Mary,
    that never was it known that anyone who fled to thy protection,
    implored thy help, or sought thy intercession,
    was left unaided.
    Inspired by this confidence,
    I fly unto thee, O Virgin of virgins, my Mother.
    To thee do I come, before thee I stand, sinful and sorrowful.
    O Mother of the Word Incarnate,
    despise not my petitions,
    but in thy mercy, hear and answer me.
    Amen.
</p>
