<h1 class="section">A. Prayers for vocations</h1>

<div><ul class="table-of-contents"/></div><p class="instruction">
    The Constitutions of our Order impose on all the members
    an obligation to foster and pray for religious vocations as the Lord
    has requested, &#8220;the harvest is rich, but the labourers are few, so
    ask the Lord of the harvest to send labourers to his harvest (Mt
    9:27). Encouraged, therefore, by Christ himself, &#8220;let all members
    intercede before God that he might constantly renew our Monastic
    Community and enrich it with new members&#8221; (art. 63). Also, the
    General Directory reminds us of our duty to pray for an increase of
    good vocations, &#8220;each Pauline Community must pray for many
    solid vocations to the Order, especially during the noon adoration
    of the Most Blessed Sacrament. Moreover, Superiors are responsible for arranging in each of our churches a designated week and
    specified days of prayer for vocations&#8221; (norm 72).
</p>

<h1>1. Prayer of Pope Pius VI</h1>

<p>
    O Jesus Christ the Divine Shepherd, you have sent your
    Apostles to be the shepherds of souls. Draw to yourself the warm and
    noble minds of young and generous men and make them your followers and servants of all.
</p>

<p>
    Grant that they may share your desire for the universal
    salvation for which you renew your Sacrifice on our altars everywhere. You are the Lord of all, who lives forever. Therefore, open
    before them new horizons that they may see and hear an unspeakable prayer for the light of truth and warmth of love of all their
    brothers and sisters today. Give them the courage to say &#8220;yes&#8221; to
    your invitation to continue your mission on earth in building up
    your Mystical Body, the Church. Make them the light of the world
    and the salt of the earth.
</p>

<p>
    We pray also that you may inspire many pure and magnanimous hearts of women and pour into them the desire for Evangelical perfection and dedication to serve the Church in their sisters
    and brothers in need. Amen.
</p>

<h1>2. Prayer for religious vocations</h1>

<p>
    O Good Jesus, our Lord and Saviour! Remember the
    words you have spoken; &#8220;Ask the lord of the harvest to send labourers
    to the harvest&#8221;. With an unshakeable trust, through the intercession
    of your Immaculate Mother and our Mother, the Queen of Jasna
    Gora and through the intercession of St. Paul the First Hermit, our
    Father, we pray that you may look down kindly upon our religious
    family and bless us abundantly. May we live in the spirit of our
    Constitutions and ever increase in your grace before God and men.
    May it grow in number with new sons, whom you call for your
    greater glory.
</p>

<p>
    Speak to them again today, &#8220;Come follow me&#8221; Make
    them worthy of your confidence and make them well disposed to
    carry on the mission of your Church. May they shine forth with
    personal sanctity, knowledge and untiring love in spreading your
    Kingdom on earth. To you along with the Father and the Holy
    Spirit be glory and honour for ever and ever. Amen.
</p>

<h1>3. Prayer for fervent priests and religious</h1>

<p>
    O God of Mercy! You desire the salvation of all people.
    For this, your only begotten Son came to us as the Good Shepherd
    to search out and rescue those who were lost. You have given your
    Son his first disciples and priests to carry on this work of redemption in his Name until the end of time. To us however, you have
    recommended we ask you, the Lord of the Harvest, to send labourers to your vineyard. Therefore, we pray most fervently, that you
    may give to the Holy Church of your Son many fervent, saintly
    priests and religious. Choose and call them yourself from among
    your people and that no one undesirable to you may remain with us and
    that no one called by you be unwelcome. Guide them with the
    grace of the Holy Spirit as you once prepared your Apostles and
    the Disciples of Christ.
</p>

<p>
    May they find joy in the contemplation of your Word.
    Pour into their hearts your warm love towards you, fidelity and
    filial affection for the Holy Church and St. Peter, the Rock, on
    which you have built your Holy Church.
</p>

<p>
    May they work tirelessly in your vineyard always with
    prudent and reasonable fervour. Give them a spirit of gentleness
    and compassion for the weak and erring. May they expect the results of their labour only from you, in humility, prayer and mortification. May they look for nothing else, except your glory and the
    salvation of souls. We ask all this through your only-begotten Son,
    Jesus Christ, the Eternal High Priest and the Shepherd of our souls,
    who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, One
    God for ever and ever. Amen.
</p>

<h1>4. Prayer to Our Lady of Jasna Gora for priestly vocations</h1>

<p>
    Our Lady of Jasna Gora, Most Holy Mother of Jesus
    Christ, our High Priest! Your Son has made you the Mother of all
    priests when he entrusted his beloved disciple John to you as your
    son.
</p>

<p>
    Mother of Priests! We ask you to watch over
    those your Son chooses to be his representatives and sharers in his
    priestly dignity. Pray for them, that they never lose this priestly
    vocation but remain faithful to the end, working fervently for the
    souls entrusted to their pastoral care.
</p>

<p>
    Mother of Priests! Pray for our fathers and mothers that
    they may offer their Sons with joy to serve your Son as priests.
</p>

<p>
    Mother of Priests! Implore for us the grace of understanding and appreciation for all the blessings which God bestows upon
    us through his holy priests. Amen.
</p>

<h1>5. Prayer to the Holy Spirit for good priestly vocations</h1>

<p>
    O God the Holy Spirit! You are the Supreme Teacher of
    all the faithful. On the Day of Pentecost, you descended upon the
    Apostles gathered in the Cenacle, in the form of fiery tongues, that
    they would become worthy dispensers of your divine mysteries.
    We pray that you may bestow the fullness of your gifts on all
    priests who are administering the mission of Jesus Christ and are
    your instruments in guiding the faithful to salvation.
</p>

<p>
    Grant them the gifts of wisdom, skill, knowledge, counsel,
    courage and piety. Fill them with the holy fear of God. Invest
    them with your abundant graces, that they may teach us in word
    and example and lead us safely to eternal life, where you receive
    glory with God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ, forever and
    ever. Amen.
</p>

<h1>6. Prayer for worthy priests and religious</h1>

<p>
    O God the Shepherd and Teacher of the faithful! To preserve the deposit of your Church and to ensure its salvific mission,
    your have instituted the holy Priesthood. You have told your
    Apostles, &#8220;The harvest is rich, but the labourers are few. Ask the
    Lord of the Harvest to send more labourers into his harvest.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
    Behold, we approach you with our heartfelt request and
    we beg you to send more priests and religious to your Holy
    Church.
</p>

<p>
    O Lord, give them the courage to say &#8220;yes&#8221; to your calling. Protect them from all dangers of the world. Invest them with
    the spirit of counsel, strength, wisdom and piety. Fill them with
    the spirit of your holy fear, that blessed with the precious gift of
    priesthood or religious profession, they may teach us how to walk
    on the road of your commandments and bring us to union with
    you, who lives and reigns for ever and ever. Amen.
</p>

<h1>7. Prayer of Pope John Paul II</h1>

<p>
    O Jesus the Good Shepherd! Accept our humble adoration and thanksgiving for all vocations which, through your Holy
    Spirit, you give unceasingly to your Church. Support the bishops,
    priests, missionaries and all consecrated persons. Grant them the
    grace to be an example of a true Evangelical life. Give them the
    strength of perseverance in their resolutions in preparation for their
    holy service. Multiply the workers of the Gospel to bring the Good
    News to all nations. Surround the children and youth of our families and of our religious communities with your protection. Give
    them the spirit of generosity and magnanimity to follow you, especially in our times. Give all the invited the energy to leave everything and to choose you, who are Love. Forgive the hesitations and
    infidelities of those you have already called.
</p>

<p>
    O Christ our Lord! Graciously hear our petitions through
    the intercession of the Most Holy Virgin Mary, your Mother and
    the Queen of the Apostles. May she who believed and generously
    said &#8220;yes&#8221; to your invitation, be the cause of joy, and accompany
    those you have called with her maternal presence and example in
    the service for your Kingdom. Amen.
</p>

<h1>8. Prayer for vocations
    <span>(Message of the Holy Father John Paul II <br/>
    delivered at the XXXII World Day of Vocations).</span>
</h1>

<p>
    Lord Jesus Christ, our Master! We stand before you and
    intently listen to your calling, &#8220;Ask the Lord of the Harvest to send
    labourers to his harvest&#8221; (Mt 9:38). Moved with these words,
    which you constantly direct to us, we pray that the young people of
    today may clearly discover and make the right choice for their state of
    life. Conscious of a great responsibility for an increase of vocations, we beg you with trust and insistency for this great gift for the
    Church. Every new vocation is a precious gift, obtained only by
    prayer and holiness of life.
</p>

<p>
    You O Lord are the source of every vocation. You choose
    for each of us the way of life and give us a personal role to play in
    your Church. Open the hearts and minds of young men and women,
    that a fresh bloom of holy vocations may remind the world of your
    love, and that all may come to know Jesus Christ, the true Light
    who has come into the world to bring an unfailing hope of eternal
    life to all men.
</p>

<p>
Be praised Lord in all those,
who have discerned their vocation,
in accordance with your thought &#8212;
and lead them on the right path.
</p>

<p>
We thank you, God, for the pastoral care
of the church for the youth, and bound with this
care that of vocations.
The young man, living the gift of youth,
stood by you and asked:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>What do I need to do, to gain eternal life?</li>
    <li>What do I need to do, for my life to have purpose?</li>
    <li>What is God&#8217;s plan for my life?</li>
    <li>What is God&#8217;s will for me?</li>
</ul>

<p>
Lord Jesus, your loving gaze gives youthful hearts the capacity to ask these essential questions. The experience of the meeting between the human heart and Your heart, filled with gentle goodness, gives the strength to seek the answers. Awareness that God loves us allows us with an open heart to receive your answer. Follow me!
</p>

<p>
    O Lord Jesus Christ! You have offered your own life for
    the salvation of all peoples and have become the Eternal Priest.
    We pray for those, who are preparing themselves for the priesthood
    and religious life. Surround them with the grace of your blessing.
    Shield them from all temptations and confirm them in holiness.
    Make them ever eager to know you better and love you more. We

    steady progress in following you, and remain united with you always. For you live and reign for ever and ever. Amen.

<h1>11. Prayer to the Most Holy Virgin Mary
    <span>Apostolic Exhortation on consecrated life
    &#8220;Vita Consecrata&#8221;</span>
</h1>

<p>
    Mary, image of the Church, the Bride without spot or
    wrinkle, which by imitating you &#8220;preserves with virginal purity an
    integral faith, a firm hope and a sincere charity&#8221;, sustain consecrated persons on their journey toward the sole and eternal blessedness.
</p>

<p>
    To you, Virgin of the Visitation, do we entrust them, that
    they may go forth to meet human needs, to bring help, but above
    all to bring Jesus. Teach them to proclaim the mighty things which
    the Lord accomplishes in the world, that all peoples may extol the
    greatness of his name. Support them in their work for the poor, the
    hungry, those without hope, the little ones and all who seek your
    Son with a sincere heart.
</p>

<p>
    To you, our Mother, who desire the spiritual and apostolic
    renewal of your sons and daughters in a response of love and complete dedication to Christ, we address our confident prayer. You
    who did the will of the Father, ever ready in obedience, courageous
    in poverty and receptive in fruitful virginity, obtain from your divine Son that all who have received the gift of following him in the
    consecrated life may be enabled to bear witness to that gift by their
    transformed lives, as they joyfully make their way with all their
    brothers and sisters toward our heavenly homeland and the light
    which will never grow dim.
</p>

<p>
    We ask you this that in everyone and in everything glory,
    adoration and love may be given to the Most High Lord of all
    things, who is the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.
