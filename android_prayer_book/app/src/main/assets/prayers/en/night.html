<h1>5. Night Prayer</h1>

<p class="instruction">
    This is the last Hour of the Breviary recited before repose.
    A brief time should be given for an examination of conscience
    (about 3 minutes) as foreseen by norm 27 of the Directory. The
    following points should be taken into consideration:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Let us place ourselves in the presence of God and
        thank Him for all graces received, particularly for
        those that were granted today.
    </li>
    <li>Let us ask the Lord God for the grace to know our sins
        and to turn away from them.
    </li>
    <li>Let us call to mind all sins we have committed today
        in our thoughts, in our speech, in our actions, by our omissions but especially the sins which we are inclined to
        commit more often. Let us pay attention to any neglect of the resolutions, made during the morning
        meditation.
    </li>
    <li>Let us make a sincere act of contrition for our sins and
        promise God to avoid them, with the help of His grace.
    </li>
    <li>Let us live in the state, in which we wish to be at the
        hour of death.
    </li>
</ul>
