<h1>11. An Act of self-offering</h1>

<p>
    O my Lady, the only Mother and Queen on earth and in
    heaven! Behold, I, an unworthy servant, kneel before you and entrust myself entirely to your mighty protection. You were always a
    mother to me, but especially now in this holy Order. Instruct and
    defend me as your son. Teach me the virtue of humility and angelic purity. Guide me by the hand amongst many hardships and
    temptations and never allow me to forget you.
</p>

<p>
    O my Mother! After God you are my only hope. Into
    your hands I entrust my life and labour. To you, I give my heart,
    that you may reign over it as my Lady and Queen. You taught me
    how to love Jesus.
</p>

<p>
    O my Queen! To serve you is my only happiness. I do
    not have any other desire, but to think, say and do everything
    that serves your glory. Amen.
</p>
