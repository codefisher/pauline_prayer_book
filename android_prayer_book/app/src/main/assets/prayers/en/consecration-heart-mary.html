<h1>8. Filial and Apostolic Consecration to the Heart of Mary
</h1>

<p>
    O Mother of God ever Virgin! I consecrate myself to
    your maternal love, as your son and servant, that you may form
    within me your Son Jesus, the messenger of the Father, anointed by
    the Holy Spirit, to proclaim the Good News to the poor.
</p>

<p>
    I entrust myself into your hands that you may send me to
    all people; your children and my brothers and sisters. Help me to
    show them the face of the Father.
</p>

<p>
    Teach me to preserve in my heart the Word of God, as
    you did, that I may become a living Gospel. Make of me an obedient instrument of your maternal love, that I may bring forth many
    sons and daughters born through the preaching of the Gospel.
</p>
