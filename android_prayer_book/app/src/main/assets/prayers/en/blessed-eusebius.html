<h1>3. Blessed Eusebius</h1>

<p class="instruction">
    Blessed Eusebius is considered a confounder of the Order
    of the Brothers of St. Paul the First Hermit. Of his initiatives the
    Pauline Order began to exist in Hungary in 1250. It was created
    of the two joined monasteries of hermits living along the Danube
    River forests: the Monastery of St. Jacob, situated upon the hill of
    Patacs and the Monastery of the Holy Cross. Blessed Eusebius, a
    Canon of Esztergom (lat. Strigonium) during the invasion of Turks
    in 1241, running for his life, found a safety in the forests of Pecs,
    where he encountered many saintly men living individually in seclusion. In 1246 he gathered them together in the Monastery of the
    Holy Cross. By doing this, he laid the foundation for the religious
    community that lived under the rule of Bishop Bartholomew. Practically, he was the first provincial of the new Order which since
    1250 has accepted a title: &#8220;Order of the Brothers of St. Paul the
    First Hermit.&#8221; In 1263 at the first General Chapter this title was
    approved, and in 1308 sanctioned by the Pope Clement V and conveyed to them by Cardinal Gentilis. Because of his efforts to establish and gain approval from the Holy See of a new religious community and his saintly life, Eusebius, has enjoyed great popularity
    among the people since his death in 1270. They venerated him like
    a church canonized Saint. His labours produced many blessed
    fruits of holiness of many members of the Order he founded. In
    popular devotion, he is invoked as the &#8220;Blessed.&#8221;

3.2 Prayer for the recognition of the devotion to Blessed Eusebius


<div class="indent">

<p>
    O God Wonderful in your Saints and Holy in all your
    works! Every age, you choose your faithful servants and trustworthy friends to carry out your salvific design and place them on all
    the pathways of your Church.
</p>

<p>
    Almighty God our loving Father! We thank you for the
    love with which you chose your servant Eusebius to serve the
    Church of Estergom as a zealous priest and poured into his heart
    the love of solitude. You inspired him to combine contemplation
    with apostolic action and a spirit of the desert with community life.
    You have made him an organizer and a cofounder of our religious
    family under the patronage of St. Paul the First Hermit.
</p>

    <p>
        O Father Most Holy! We ask you, through his love of the
        Cross of Christ and his filial love for the Most Holy Mother of God
        ever Virgin, the Mother and Protectress of our Order; grant us the
        fervour to venerate him at your altars by the solemn decision of the
        Church and to confirm from time immemorial the popular cult of
        our Father and Master. We ask for this grace, especially now, in
        the hour of difficult situation of the Church in his homeland. May
        the splendour of his virtues which once he shed on our brothers on
        earth, particularly his humility, prudence, mercy, purity of heart,
        piety and love of prayer, remind us of our call to holiness today.
    </p>

    <p>
        O Heavenly Father! May he keep reminding us of the
        venerable traditions of our forefathers, whom he inspired at the
        very beginning. Grant us the grace to keep our gaze on Mary, our
        Mother and Queen, that under her maternal protection and guidance, united in the love of the Cross, we may happily arrive, after
        our earthy pilgrimage, to the everlasting Home of our Eternal Father in Heaven.<br/>
        We ask you this through Christ our Lord. Amen.
    </p>
