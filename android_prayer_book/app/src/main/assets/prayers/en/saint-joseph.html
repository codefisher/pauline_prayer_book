<h1>1. Saint Joseph</h1>

<p class="instruction">
    St. Joseph was a righteous man, to whom the divine Providence has entrusted the privilege to participate decisively in the
    greatest mysteries of salvation. It was he who obeyed the command of the Angel and took Mary into his house as his wife. He
    believed that she had truly conceived the Divine Child through the
    power of the Holy Spirit (cf Mt. 1:19-25). When mortal danger for
    the Child from King Herod arrived, &#8220;so Joseph got up and taking
    the Child and his Mother with him, left that night for Egypt&#8221; (Mt
    2:14). When the danger passed, he &#8220;returned to the land of Israel,
    and settled in the town of Nazareth in Galilee. In this way the
    words spoken through the prophets were to be fulfilled &#8216;He will be
    called a Nazarene&#8217; &#8220;(Mt. 2:23). When Jesus began his public mission, St. Joseph appeared at the Jordan River, where he was baptized by St. John. Jesus was thought to be the son of Joseph (cf. Lk
    3:23). In the Church&#8217;s liturgy and in the piety of the believes, St.
    Joseph stands as a man of justice, a most faithful servant of the
    living God, Spouse of the Most Holy Virgin Mary and a silent witness of divine mysteries. &#8220;He stands on the threshold of Old and
    New Testaments. In his person, the dignity of Patriarchs and the
    oracles of the Prophets, find their fulfilment&#8221; (St. Bernardino of
    Siena). The cult to St. Joseph, in the Pauline tradition does not
    exceed specifically the general veneration, due to St. Joseph and
    practiced in the Catholic Church.

<h2>1.2 Prayer to St. Joseph
    <span>(recited after the Rosary)</span>
</h2>

<div class="indent">
    <p>
        O St. Joseph, we flee to your protection in all our necessities. Having invoked the help of your Holy Spouse Mary, we also
        ask for your aid. By the love that joined you to the Mother of God
        ever Virgin and by the fatherly care, with which you caressed the
        Child Jesus, we beg you humbly to look down upon the heritage
        obtained by the precious Blood of Jesus Christ and through your
        powerful intercession assist us in our needs.
    </p>
    <p>
        O providential Guardian of the Holy Family, watch constantly over the posterity of Jesus Christ. Remove from us, our
        beloved Father, all error and corruption. Come to the rescue of our
        struggles with the powers of darkness. As once you saved the
        Child Jesus from the danger that imperilled his life, so today defend the Church of God from all adversities and snares of the devil.
        Surround us with your constant protection, that following your
        example, and strengthened with your help, we may live piously, die
        happily and obtain everlasting happiness in heaven. Amen.
    </p>
