<h1>4. The Holy Rosary</h1>

<p class="instruction">
    Our religious Constitutions remind us that &#8220;we honour
    Mary each day by reciting at least one portion of the Holy Rosary
    and praying the Litany of Loreto (Norm 66.)
</p>

<p class="instruction">
    From among the fifteen mysteries of the Holy Rosary, only
    two are not mentioned in the Holy Scriptures. This is a reason why
    Pope Pius XII called the Rosary &#8220;a summary of the Gospel.&#8221; This
    is confirmed also by our Constitution: &#8220;Our devotion to the Most
    Holy Virgin is based on the Gospels and teaching of the
    Church&#8221; (Art 61)
</p>

<h2>Part One &#8212; The Joyful Mysteries</h2>

<h3>The first joyful mystery
    <span>The Annunciation:</span></h3>

<p>
    &#8220;In the sixth month, the Angel Gabriel was sent by God to
    a town in Galilee called Nazareth, to a Virgin, whose name was
    Mary. The Angel said to her: &#8216;Rejoice, so highly favoured&#8230;You
    are to conceive and bear a Son, and you will name him Jesus&#8217;&#8221; (Lk
    1:26-31)
</p>

<h3>The second joyful mystery
    <span>The Visitation:</span>
</h3>

<p>&#8220;Mary set out at that time and went as quickly as she
    could to a town in the hill country of Judah&#8230;Now as soon as
    Elizabeth heard Mary&#8217;s greeting&#8230;she gave a loud cry and said, &#8216;Of all women you are the most blessed, and blessed is the fruit of your
    womb&#8217;&#8221; (Lk 1:39-42).
</p>

<h3>The third joyful mystery
    <span>The Nativity:</span>
</h3>

<p>&#8220;While they were there the time came for her to have her
    Child, and she gave birth to a Son, her first-born. She wrapped him
    in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger because there was
    no room for them at the inn&#8221; (Lk 2: 2-7)
</p>

<h3>The fourth joyful mystery
    <span>The Presentation:</span>
</h3>

<p>&#8220;And when the day came for them to be purified as laid
    down by the Law of Moses, they took him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord&#8230;and also offered in sacrifice&#8230;a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons&#8221; (Lk 2: 22-24)
</p>

<h3>The fifth joyful mystery
    <span>The finding of the Child Jesus in the Temple:</span>
</h3>

<p>&#8220;Every year his parents used to go to Jerusalem for the feast of the
    Passover. When they were on their way home after the feast, the
    boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem&#8230;Three days later, they
    found him in the Temple, sitting among the doctors, listening to
    them and asking them questions&#8221; (Lk 2:41-46).

    women: &#8216;There is no need for you to be afraid. I know you are

    which they were sitting; and something appeared to them that
    seemed like tongues of fire; these separated and came to rest on the
    head of each of them. They were filled with the Holy Spirit, and
    began to speak foreign languages as the Spirit gave them the gift of
    speech&#8221; (Acts 2: 1-4).
</p>
