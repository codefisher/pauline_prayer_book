<h1 class="index">Chapter VIII: The Customs of the Order</h1>

<p>
    In our Order the following customs have been handed on by the tradition of our Fathers.
</p>

<ol>
    <li> We make a profound bow during the recitation of the &#8220;<em>Glory to the Father and to the
        Son, etc</em>&#8221; as well as during longer conclusions to prayers and hymns.
    </li>
    <li> During the Forty Hours devotion the Liturgy of the Hours and Adoration take place in the
        Church before the Blessed Sacrament exposed. The same is true during the three days of Holy
        Week. In both instances we strive also to spend more time privately in Adoration of the
        Eucharistic Christ.
    </li>
    <li> Before retiring at night, we recite in our cells with our arms extended in the form of a
        Cross, three Hail Marys and the invocation to the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Mary
        together with the prayer to St. Paul the First Hermit.
    </li>
    <li> Upon awaking in the morning and hearing the knock on our door we respond with &#8220;Ave
        Maria&#8221;.
    </li>
    <li> To conclude our meetings or get-togethers we recite the following prayer:
        <div class="psalm"><div class="stanza"><div class="psalm-line"><div>Maria, Mater gratiae,</div></div><div class="psalm-line"><div>Mater misericordiae,</div></div><div class="psalm-line"><div>Tu nos ab hoste prot&#233;g&#233;,</div></div><div class="psalm-line"><div>et mortis,hora suscipe.</div></div></div><div class="stanza"><div class="psalm-line"><div>Jesu, Tibi sit Gloria,</div></div><div class="psalm-line"><div>Cum Patre et Almo Spiritu</div></div><div class="psalm-line"><div>in sempiterna saecula.</div></div><div class="psalm-line"><div>Amen.</div></div></div></div></li>
    <li> When walking in procession from the choir to the refectory or the reverse order we cover
        our heads with the hood. Aside from this time, the use of the hood as a head covering is
        optional.
    </li>
    <li> Our Monks are also allowed the use of the skullcap. (Zucchetto) It is not used during the
        celebration of Mass or during the exposition of the Blessed Sacrament. It is recommended
        that at all Community appearances its use should be dictated by Community Consensus.
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            At Jasna Gora on Marian feast days at the conclusion of Vespers in the Church, we form a
            Eucharistic procession to the chapel of Our Lady singing: &#8220;The Magnificat&#8221;. There, before
            the miraculous icon, the litany of Loreto is chanted together with prayers according to the
            Jasna Gora melody (in Latin) &#8220;<em>Monstra te esse Matrem.</em>&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
            This is done with hands raised. Then follows the hymn &#8220;<em>O Maria Virgo Honesta</em>".
            This devotion has been traditionally called &#8220;<em>Kleczki</em>&#8221; or &#8220;The Kneeling Prayers&#8221;
        </p>
    </li>

    <li> Whenever we officially come together in choir, the Church, or the refectory, etc., we keep
        to the following rules of precedence: we take our places according to the office which we
        hold &#8211; Major Superior with administration officers, the local Superior and his substitute.
        Ex-Generals follow the Vicar of the Order and in our Houses they are entitled to take their
        place before the Prior. All other Monks take their place according to their calling and
        temporary profession in our Order.
    </li>
    <li> Upon entering or leaving the refectory we make a profound bow of our head to the Cross-.
        During lunch, we read portions of Holy Scripture. During this time food should not be
        served. During suppertime the martyrology is read. Meals begin and conclude with a signal
        from the Superior.
    </li>
    <li> The daily common recitation of the invocations to St. Paul the First hermit should take
        place at a time provided for this in the daily horarium. We also cultivate devotion to the
        Guardian Angels and in the novitiate, invocations to the Guardian Angels are recited daily.
    </li>
    <li> Our Order maintains the custom of blessing children especially on the Solemnity of St.
        Paul, our Father.
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The essential elements in our Pauline coat-of-arms are:
        </p>
        <p>
            A palm tree with a raven at its top and lions resting their paws against its trunk.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li> In accordance with established custom we clothe the deceased Pauline in his habit with head
        covered by the hood and white socks covering the feet and without shoes. The coffin bearing
        the body of the deceased is then exposed in a public place (at Jasna Gora in the chapel of
        our Holy Patriarch).
    </li>
    <li> The blessing at the conclusion of Lauds, Vespers and Compline is given by the Superior.
    </li>
