<h1 class="index">Chapter I: The Cultivation of Vocations and Reception into the Order</h1>


<h2 id="art63">Article 63</h2>

<p>
    The special call to imitate Christ through the practice of the Evangelical counsels is the
    precious gift of loving God, both for the one called as well as for the Order itself. All of our
    Monks are responsible for the growth of the Pauline Family as well as for the carrying out of
    its mission in the Church and in the world. Encouraged, therefore, by Christ Himself (Mt. 9:38)
    let all Members intercede before God that He might constantly renew our Monastic Community and
    enrich it with new members.
</p>


<h2 id="art64">Article 64</h2>

<p>
    The most effective means of encouraging others to give themselves to God is through a witness of
    personal and Community Life. Therefore, members of the Order should cultivate both friendliness
    and good will by means of hard work and humble spirit filled with fraternal charity and
    Apostolic dedication &#8211; all in a spirit of joy. Let them do this taking care to help others in
    their discernment as to whether God is calling them to our family. Let them effectively do this
    through devotion to Our Lady, so that through this they make the choice of those called by God
    to our religious family easier.
</p>


<h2 id="art65">Article 65</h2>

<p>
    It behoves us to methodically, systematically and with all our zeal to undertake all efforts
    directed towards awakening vocations. All Paulines are obliged to take part in this great work,
    according to their abilities and the demands of their time. Major Superiors are to appoint
    Vocations directors, who are to direct our vocational efforts. We should not begrudge
    difficulties and expenses in this goal, so that the Pauline Order will let itself be known in
    the wider community, in which Divine Providence places it in.
</p>

<h2 id="art66">Article 66</h2>

<p>
    Only those candidates should be received into the Order who are distinguished by a sincere
    intention and who display physical, emotional, intellectual and moral signs giving hope that
    they will be capable of carrying out our Community&#8217;s Mission.
</p>

<h2 id="art67">Article 67</h2>

<p>
    Candidates must undergo a period of postulancy before beginning novitiate. For candidates to the
    Brotherhood the period last six months. For other candidates the Major Superior decides as to
    the type and duration of postulancy.
</p>
<p>
    Postulancy is that initial period of testing and gradual
    adjustment which leads one into the Pauline manner of living. It should take place in a House
    designated by a Major Superior and under the direction of an experienced Monk.
</p>

<h2 id="art68">Article 68</h2>


<ol>
    <li> After the completion of postulancy it is by the decision of the Major Superior in
        consultation with his Council that a candidate is admitted to the Novitiate. Only those
        candidates are to be admitted who on the basis of prior testing, together with the
        recommendations, observations and opinions which have been made during the time of
        postulancy or other manner of testing, give prudent evidence that they are called by God.
        Before the actual ceremony of reception to Novitiate, candidates must make a six-day
        retreat.
    </li>
    <li> According to the norms of Canon Law the following are excluded from reception into the
        Order (Can. 643):
        <ol>
            <li> Those who have not completed their seventeenth years;</li>
            <li> Those who are bound by marriage vows:</li>
            <li> Those who at the time are bound by Sacred Commitment to any institute of
                Consecrated Life;
            </li>
            <li> Those seeking to enter the Order under duress, grave fear or fraud;</li>
            <li> Those who have concealed their membership in any institute of Consecrated Life;
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li> Superiors must not receive diocesan clerics into Novitiate without the consent of their
        Ordinary. Neither must they receive those who are burdened with any debt, which they are
        unable to honour.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    Those who wish to transfer to our Order from another religious institute or seminary must have
    the consent of their component superiors (Cans. 642- 645; 684, &#167;.1)
