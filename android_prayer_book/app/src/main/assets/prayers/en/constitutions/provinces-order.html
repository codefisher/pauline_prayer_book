<h1 class="index">Chapter IV: The Provinces of the Order</h1>


<h2 id="art136">Article 136</h2>

<p>
    In our Order, in connection to the Historical tradition of the Order, Provinces may be created,
    in as far the is required by: the Spiritual Good, Development of the Order and other serious
    reasons.
</p>
<p>
    Province is understood as meaning the union of at least three houses under the
    direction of a Major Superior that is the Provincial, canonically erected (cf: Can. 621, Can
    608-610 and Can. 115 &#167;2).
</p>
<p>
    When erecting a province account should be taken of the capacity of organizational, formational
    and economic self-sufficiency.
</p>
<p>
    Every Province is governed by its statutes confirmed by the
    General Chapter or the Father General with the decisive vote of his council.
</p>


<h2 id="art137">Article 137</h2>

<p>
    The General Chapter or the Father General with the deciding voice of the Definitorium (Can. 581)
    erects provinces. This is done by a Decree of Erection in which the geographical territory is
    described, the number of houses included in its make-up together with the specific mission of
    the Province. The Father General calls for the first Provincial General Chapter.
</p>
<p>
    A Province is headed by a Provincial chosen at the Chapter. He must have at least ten years of
    Solemn Profession and must be confirmed by the Father General. Assisting him is a Council
    composed of four Definitors of whom the first will be the Vicar. Also assisting the provincial
    is the administrator for the goods of the Province and a secretary.
</p>


<h2 id="art138">Article 138</h2>

<p>
    The Provincial and his Council consisting of four Definitors, the secretary and administrator of
    the Province are chosen according to the norms of the General Directory at the ordinary
    Provincial Chapter for a period of three years. The first Definitor who must be professed
    solemnly at least for five years fulfils the function of Vicar of the Province.
</p>
<p>
    The Provincial who first notifies the Father General convenes the Chapter. The Father General
    either personally or through his delegates has the right of participating in this Chapter. Care
    must be taken that the time for convening Provincial Chapters should not conflict with times set
    for General Chapters.
</p>
<p>
    Members of the Provincial Chapter are the following:
</p>

<ol class="alph">
    <li> The Father General or his delegate, the Father Provincial (or quasi Provincial) with his
        Council;
    </li>
    <li> Delegates of the whole Province chosen according to our Order&#8217;s law should be at least of
        the same number as those who take part in the Chapter by virtue of the law itself.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    The Presider of the provincial Chapter for the entire time of its duration will be the Father
    General (or his delegate).
</p>


<h2 id="art139">Article 139</h2>

<p>
    The authority of the Provincial, who should be a Monk with at least ten years of Solemn
    Profession, is valid for a full three years and is limited to his Province. He enjoys the powers
    of a Major Superior. He should be an individual endowed with those qualities expected of a Major
    superior both by Canon Law and in our Constitutions. His authority extends to things both
    spiritual and material, namely: Matters pertaining to all the monasteries, persons and those
    governing in the Province. It belongs to his competence to transfer individual Monks from one
    monastery to another. The authority to transfer Monks from one Province to another belongs to
    the Father General. It is the Provincial&#8217;s duty to convene and prepare for Provincial Chapters
    both ordinary and extraordinary. Before taking office the Provincial must take a Profession of
    Faith (Can. 833, &#167;. 8).
</p>


<h2 id="art140">Article 140</h2>

<p>
    It belongs to the duties of the Provincial to make a yearly visitation either personally or
    through his delegates to all the Houses of the Province. He must also on a yearly basis make a
    report to the Father General as to the state of his Province.
</p>
<p>
    Although his authority is valid ordinarily for three years, after its expiration, he is eligible
    to be re-elected for a second three-year period by the same Chapter. A third consecutive
    three-year term is not allowed.
</p>


<h2 id="art141">Article 141</h2>

<p>
    In the event that the above-mentioned conditions for creating a province are not fully
    established, the General Chapter or the Father General with the consent of his Council may
    legitimately establish Quasi-Provinces according to Can. 620 and appoint Their Quasi-Provincial
    and the method of choosing his Council. In other cases, for a just cause the Father General,
    after obtaining the consent of his council, shall appoint his Delegate whose powers are
    determined each time by decree.
