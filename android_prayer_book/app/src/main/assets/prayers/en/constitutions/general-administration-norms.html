<h1 class="index">Chapter III: The General Administration</h1>

<h2 class="index">The Father General</h2>


<h2 id="norm147">Norm 147</h2>

<p>
    The Father General is expected to have an accurate knowledge as to the state and problems of our
    Religious Community. Therefore, he should demand from the Provincials and Priors a report as to
    the state of their monasteries drawn up according to a previously prepared questionnaire.
    Likewise, it is his obligation to inform the Community of current affairs in the Church and the
    Order. He does this through general letters sent out at least once a year as well as through his
    special informational organ called &#8216;the Bulletin of the Order of St. Paul the First Hermit&#8217;
    edited under the leadership of the Secretary-General.
</p>

<h2 class="index">The Vicar-General</h2>

<h2 id="norm148">Norm 148</h2>

<p>
    The Vicar of the Order cooperates with the Father General in a spirit of unity helping him to
    carry out his responsibilities for the good and the development of our Monastic Community.
</p>
<p>
    In this regard, he should support all good initiatives. He should manifest a kindly interest in
    the personal matters of brethren and when the need arises, he should present their legitimate
    needs and difficulties to the Father General.
</p>
<p>
    He must never, however, weaken the authority of the highest Superior or in any way detract from
    the respect and obedience, which is due him.
</p>


<h2 id="norm149">Norm 149</h2>

<p>
    In the event of death of the Father General those things which pertain to his office and
    especially his documents should be preserved by the Vicar intact assuring their safe keeping so
    that at the proper time he might present them to the new General of the Order.
</p>

<h2 class="index">The Definitors-General</h2>

<h2 id="norm150">Norm 150</h2>

<p>
    The Definitors-General, conscious of the fact that they bear co-responsibility with the Father
    General for the whole Order and especially for the rightness and effective execution of
    decisions which have been passed must acquaint themselves ever more perfectly with the
    Constitutions and the Directory as well as with the actual state of the situation, the problems
    of the whole Order and with individual communities.
</p>
<p>
    In order to execute their obligations of counsel in a just and loving manner they must often
    invoke the Holy Spirit for necessary enlightenment and his gifts.
</p>


<h2 id="norm151">Norm 151</h2>

<p>
    The Definitors meet whenever they are called together by the Father General for a session of the
    Definitorium. They should be notified of these sessions ahead of time so that they might
    acquaint themselves of the agenda beforehand.
</p>
<p>
    Since they are called upon to work with the Father General in looking for new ways and solutions
    for the greater good of the Order they should not hesitate to come forward with their own
    initiatives always taking care to do so within the bounds of proper charity and obedience. As
    regards the subject matter and course of discussion, they are bound to strict secrecy.
</p>

<h2 id="norm152">Norm 152</h2>

<p>
    The good of the Order demands that the Definitors General to the extent that this is possible
    should be immersed in the various areas of the life of the Order provided in these spheres.
    These various activities, however, should not make difficult the fulfilment of their office,
    which by its very nature demands that they live in the residence of the Father General.
</p>


<h2 id="norm153">Norm 153</h2>

<p>
    When a Definitor General becomes aware of any situation which poses a threat to the Order he
    should inform the Father General. Likewise, should the Definitors General become aware of any
    situation which concern either the person or the office of Father General which would constitute
    an impropriety let them bring it to his attention in a respectful manner. They should also
    remind the Father General of things that should be done being available to assist by their own
    service and sacrifice.
</p>


<h2 class="index">The Procurator of the Order at the Holy See</h2>

<h2 id="norm154">Norm 154</h2>

<p>
    Prior to his leaving for Rome, the Procurator-General takes an oath according to the formula
    found in the ceremonial.
</p>
<p>
    All matters which he handles especially at the Roman Curia must be recorded in a separate book
    which he makes available to the Father General or his visitators for examination.
</p>
<p>
    He is also authorised to handle matters for outsiders insofar as the Father General does not
    forbid this.
</p>

<h2 class="index">The Secretary-General</h2>

<h2 id="norm155">Norm 155</h2>

<p>
    The Secretary General takes the minutes of the meetings of the Definitorium, reminds the Father
    General about his most immediate duties and helps with correspondence. He also prepares the
    texts of the resolutions of the Definitorium, the Decrees of the Father General and all the more
    important texts regarding the general governance of the Order.
</p>
<p>
    All these writings and acts he gives to the Father General for confirmation and to be signed, as
    well as stamping them with the seal of the Order. He also organises and arranges meetings with
    the Father General for those who wish to see him, as well as arranging audiences and taking care
    of business.
</p>
<p>
    When the time comes for him to relinquish his post, he hands over to the new secretary the
    office of the secretariat together with the archives and introduces him to the procedures of his
    office.
</p>
<p>
    He also cooperates with the Chronicler of the Order.
