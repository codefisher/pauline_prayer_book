<h1 class="index">Chapter VIII: Visitation in the Order</h1>


<h2 id="art175">Article 175</h2>

<p>
    In the spirit of faith, each individual Monk and all our communities see in the person of the
    Major Superior the Father of the Religious family and the representative of God Himself as well
    as a guide on the road of monastic living. Therefore, they value highly his presence in their
    midst and welcome every opportunity to meet with him
</p>
<p>
    The Father General in his concern for the good of the entire Community shall make a visitation
    of the entire Order at least twice during his six-year term of office. The Provincial shall
    carry out a similar visitation of his province one a year. Moreover, should any monastery find
    itself in any situation, which would require an extraordinary visitation let the Major Superior
    carry it out immediately.
</p>
<p>
    For a legitimate reason the visitation can be carried out by a competent delegate.
</p>


<h2 id="art176">Article 176</h2>

<p>
    The purposes for the visitation by Major Superiors undertaken for the good of our Houses are the
    following:
</p>

<ol class="alph">
    <li> A deepening of Community Life based on faithful living out of the Religious Vows in
        Fraternal Charity as well as furthering the unity and peace of the Community.
    </li>
    <li> The raising of the spiritual and monastic level of life which has its roots in the Gospel
        and in the observance of the statutes of our Constitutions in a spirit of love.
    </li>
    <li> Making more efficient our activities and our style of pastoral ministry in our Churches and
        the renewal of the zealous apostolic spirit both on the part of superiors and monks in the
        spirit of seeking to serve the people of God.
    </li>
    <li> Coming to know and in the case of necessity improving the material situation of the house
        as well as evaluating the administration of temporal goods and seeing to it that all
        obligations are met which flow from gifts or bequests received;
    </li>
    <li> To look into other matters connected with situations and given problems of a given House.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="art177">Article 177</h2>

<ol>
    <li> In order to attain the end for which he is making his visit, the Visitator must make every
        effort to obtain a general yet exact picture of the problems and works of the Community,
        which he is visiting.
        In a spirit of prudence he should supplement his own personal and specific observations with
        those of the members of the given Monastery together with the observations of other interested
        parties. It should be his concern to try to effectively influence by giving encouragement and
        instruction; giving due recognition to each member; to make sound recommendation and if need be
        to give just reprimand and even punish guilty parties.
    </li>
    <li> For a good reason the Major Superior might change the Prior of a House as well as members
        of the governing body and to appoint others after consultation with members of the House
        (without consulting the Definitors).
    </li>
    <li> Delegated Visitators have no authority to remove the Prior from office. He can, however,
        suspend him from office and entrust his position to the Subprior for the interim period as
        he awaits the decision of the Major Superior to whose attention he has brought the matter.
    </li>
    <li> Our Monks are to deal with the Visitator in a trusting manner. They should answer his
        legitimate questions in a spirit of truth and love. Moreover, no one is permitted in any way
        to divert members from this obligation or otherwise to impede the scope of the visitation
        (Can. 628, &#167;. 3).
    </li>
</ol>
