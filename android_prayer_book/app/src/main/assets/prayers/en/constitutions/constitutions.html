<h1 class="index">Chapter XI: The Constitutions</h1>


<h2 id="art195">Article 195</h2>

<p>
    The Constitutions of the Order of St. Paul the First Hermit, approved by the Apostolic See,
    constitutes for us an accurate interpretation of life according to the evangelical counsels. it
    gives structure to the life of our Community and offer guidelines in helping us to realize our
    mission.
</p>
<p>
    By making profession, we accepted the Constitutions as a sure guide in leading to the fulfilment
    of our personal Religious Vocation and thereby to holiness and salvation.
</p>
<p>
    The directory is first and foremost the authentic guide in giving form to the Laws of the
    Constitutions in our daily living taking into account the conditions of the present time.
</p>


<h2 id="art196">Article 196</h2>

<p>
    The Constitutions derive their ultimate binding authority from the evangelical law of love
    according to which gives norms for religious life. The degree of seriousness of individual norms
    is dependent upon the importance of these norms for Religious Life itself even to the point of
    binding under pain of serious sin. Included in this last category would be all serious
    violations of the Religious Vows as well as harm done to the Community and basic contempt for
    the precepts of the Constitutions.
</p>


<h2 id="art197">Article 197</h2>

<p>
    Our attitude toward the laws of the Order should be one of great respect recognizing in them a
    great good which seeks to guard the spiritual heritage which is ours. Only the Apostolic See has
    the authority to make changes in the Constitutions. It is the General Chapter which petitions
    for such change with the two-thirds agreement of its members.
</p>


<h2 id="art198">Article 198</h2>

<p>
    The General Chapter can suspend either in whole or in part norms contained in the directory and
    is able to introduce new ones. These norms approved by the next General Chapter have the same
    binding force as all the norms of the directory.
</p>


<h2 id="art199">Article 199</h2>

<p>
    The Apostolic See is the competent authority in interpreting the Constitutions. In individual
    cases of doubt, the General Chapter or the Father General together with his council can give
    practical clarifications.
</p>


<h2 id="art200">Article 200</h2>

<p>
    Each Pauline should read and meditate upon the Constitutions and Directory and examine his life
    in the light of these same so that they may become for us, life-giving and may guide our daily
    actions.
</p>


<h2 id="art201">Article 201</h2>

<p>
    We should carry out the norms of the Constitutions and Directory with zeal not as though through
    some cult of the letter of the law but by a conscious love for the good which they serve. We
    should bring them to life through our own submission to the Holy Spirit who has given us the
    call to follow Christ and who through these same Constitutions and Directory constantly guides
    us into the freedom of the children of God in the spirit of the Son of the Eternal Father.
