<h1 class="index">Chapter I: The Mission of the Order of St. Paul the First Hermit</h1>

<p>
    The mission, spirituality and apostolic activity of our Order have taken form over a period of
    centuries. The very beginning and roots of our Order gave a specific character to its life. The
    very first Paulines who constituted the religious family under the leadership of blessed
    Eusebius (d. 1270) brought with them an eremitical love for liturgical prayer, and divine
    contemplation in solitude as well as a very strict manner of life.
</p>
<p>
    Their concern, however, for others was manifested in pastoral service. Evidence of this is found
    in the rule given to our Fathers by Bartholomew, the bishop of Pecs, &#8220;<em>let them be seen by others
    as irreproachable, let them be a light of example for others, so that in this way they may be
    able to offer God service which is pleasing not only through their own excellent conduct but
    also through efforts at the conversion and salvation of others whose hearts would be moved by
    their admonitions</em>&#8221;. As a result, the Danubian eremitical life which showed a concern for the
    needs of people or in other words was very open towards assisting in the salvation of one&#8217;s
    neighbour, was from the very beginning of our Order a definite characteristic of our
    spirituality.
</p>
<p>
    A clear and lasting contributing force in this direction was the rule of St. Augustine, which
    was given to us by the Apostolic See in the year 1308. In this Rule, the law of Charity of God
    and neighbour takes precedence. The holy Lawgiver universally acknowledged as the theologian of
    love and patron of Christian humanism had an enormous influence on the apostolic work of the
    Paulines throughout the ages, thereby, enriching our heritage with new values.
</p>
<p>
    As our Order, to be involved in new areas of Pastoral ministry expanded its works to include
    missionary activity and the apostolate of education. History bears testimony to this that the
    Pauline Community was always concerned for the actual needs of the Church and the practical
    needs of society as well. As result, our Religious Family took on an attitude of elasticity,
    which allowed it to embrace ever-new obligations and forms of Pastoral Ministry always, however,
    in accordance with the spirit of our Order. This became a very basic element giving form to our
    community. With the passage of time, the Order assumed the responsibility for shrines and
    churches, which as a rule contained some image of the Mother of God and were very active centres
    of Marian cult and pilgrimage. As a result, the spirituality of our Order took on a very basic
    and definite Marian character, which could also be seen in its works and Apostolic endeavours.
    As a result, it is a universally accepted conviction both of our members and the faithful that
    we are a Marian Order. This seems to be confirmed even more by the ever-increasing role of the
    Shrine at Jasna Gora not only for the Church in Poland but also for the whole Catholic world.
    This has even lead the Holy Father, Pope John Paul II, to label as one of the basic
    characteristics of the Pauline Order its &#8220;<em>Jasna Gora Charism</em>&#8221;.
</p>
<p>
    A study of the development of our Order brings to light the fact of our concern for balance and
    harmony regarding a life of prayer and Apostolic Activity. This concern is evidence in the
    decree on the renewal of Religious life. &#8220;<em>&#8230;Some religious communities according to their rule
    or constitutions closely join the apostolic life to choir duty and monastic observances. These
    should so adapt their manner of life to the demands of the apostolate appropriate to them that
    they observe faithfully their way of life, since it has been of great service to the Church.</em>&#8221;
    (<em>Perfectae Caritatis</em>. 9).
</p>
<p>
    The aforementioned events in the development of the Order exerted a decided influence on the
    distinct character on the spirituality of our Pauline family making it distinct among other
    Religious Families and giving us our own proper character as regards Apostolic Work and mission.
</p>
<p>
    This Directory serves as an explanation of the thought behind the Laws of the Constitutions and
    helps to understand better the essence of our Order and its mission so that we might better
    fulfil that mission in our own life and activity.
