<h1 class="index">Chapter I: The Name and Character of the Order</h1>

<h2 id="art1">Article 1</h2>
<ol>
    <li>The <span index="Pauline Order">Pauline Order &#8211; The Order of St. Paul the First Hermit (OSPPE)</span> &#8211; arose in the 13<sup>th</sup>
        century in Hungary. Composed of <span index="Hermit">hermits</span> who, obedient to the call of the <span index="Church">Church</span>, were
        determined to live out the <span index="Evangelical Counsels">Evangelical Counsels</span> in a common life. They chose as their
        principal Patron <span index="St. Paul the First Hermit">St. Paul of Thebes</span> and it is from his name that they received the title
        Paulines.
    </li>
    <li>Bartholomew, the Bishop of the Five Churches, who wrote the first rule, and <span index="Eusebius">Blessed Eusebius</span>
        of Esztergom, contributed to the foundation of the Order. It was Eusebius who gathered
        together the hermits, who at that time, were living separately and asked for the rule of St.
        Augustine to become the norm of the Order. It is in the spirit of that Rule that our Fathers
        lived throughout the centuries.
    </li>
    <li>In the course of the years, our <span index="Pauline Order">Order</span> assumed the form of an exempt clerical Order of
        pontifical rite and so it remains today in accordance with the norms of Canon Law. ( Can.
        588 &#167; 2, Can. 591, Can. 593)
    </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="art2">Article 2</h2>

<p>
    The members of our <span index="Pauline Order">Order</span>, just as our Fathers of old, as they strive to imitate <span index="Christ">Christ</span> most
    faithfully under the influence of the <span index="Holy Spirit">Holy Spirit</span>, seek to give themselves to loving God above
    all else. They dedicate themselves to the glory of God and to the building up of the Church and
    the salvation of the world by virtue of a new and more special obligation, in order that in this
    way they might attain prefect charity in the service of the Kingdom of God becoming at the same
    time, by these means, a clear sign of eternal life. (cf. Can. 573,&#167; 1)
</p>

<h2 id="art3">Article 3</h2>

<p>
    The characteristics of the Pauline Community which express the rich heritage, healthy
    traditions, and historical evolution of the Order, and which also define more closely its
    mission, are the following:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>The cultivation of the <span index="Contemplation">contemplation</span> of God in <span index="Solitude">solitude</span> and the development of a love for
        <span index="Liturgy">liturgical</span> <span index="Prayer">prayer</span>;
    </li>
    <li>A life characterised by diligent work and <span index="Evangelical Poverty">poverty</span> together with the practice of <span index="Penance">penance</span></li> as a
        means of sharing in the salvific self-immolation of Christ;
    
    <li>A special devotion to the <span index="Mary">Mother of God</span> which expresses itself principally in the imitation
        of Our Lady in the action of one&#8217;s personal sanctification and in the carrying out of
        apostolic works;
    </li>
    <li>Apostolic zeal in the service of the Church and in the service of our neighbour, under the
        guidance of the <span index="Holy Spirit">Holy Spirit</span> and always accommodating to the signs of the times. This zeal
        expresses itself most especially through the preaching of the Word of God, through a life of
        witness, the celebration of the Sacraments, and most especially through the <span index="Sacrament!of Penance">Sacrament of
            Penance</span>.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="art4">Article 4</h2>

<p>
    The <span index="Mary">Most Holy Virgin Mary, Queen of Hermits,</span> is both Mother and special protectress of the
    Order. Our Fathers gave expression to this from time immemorial even to our last General
    Chapter, at which time the entire <span index="Pauline Community">Pauline Community</span> was entrusted to her. We acknowledge her
    likewise as the highest authority in the Order. As a result of Our Lady&#8217;s role in the Mystery of
    Christ and the Church, the imitation of her life and promoting devotion to her is a special
    characteristic of <span index="Spirituality">Pauline Spirituality</span>. Likewise, our apostolic activities should have a Marian
    Character, in particular the <span index="Shrine">Shrines</span> that have been entrusted to the Order among which Jasna
    Gora in Cz&#281;stochowa holds the first place.
