<h1 class="index">Chapter III: Formation leading to Priesthood</h1>


<h2 id="norm87">Norm 87</h2>

<p>
    The future of our Order depends in a large measure on the quality of its Priests whose formation
    takes place in the seminary. Consequently, the seminary should be erected in a Monastery, which
    would provide conditions suited for a well-rounded preparation to the priesthood and where there
    is likewise the possibility of benefiting from such aids as libraries, specialists, as well as
    contacts with other educational centres, etc.
</p>

<h2 id="norm88">Norm 88</h2>

<p>
    The Major Superior should:
</p>

<ol class="alph">
    <li> Take an interest in the work of both students and professors as well as their ability to
        work well together. He should be concerned with their scholastic achievements and input into
        the Order&#8217;s activities;
    </li>
    <li> He should make every effort to take personal part in the more important events in the life
        of the seminary such as the beginning and the end of the academic year, ordinations to
        priesthood, the patronal feast day etc.
    </li>
    <li> During the visitation he should acquaint himself with the total picture of the formation of
        students paying special attention to their progress in studies;
    </li>
    <li> Before solemn Profession and ordination he should have a personal talk with those
        concerned;
    </li>
    <li> He approves the statutes and the yearly course of studies for the seminary;</li>
    <li>
        <p>
            He should make certain that the material conditions are present for the proper
            functioning of the seminary.
        </p>
        <p>
            With this end in mind, he determines among other things various services, which
            individual monasteries could render to assist the seminary.
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="norm89">Norm 89</h2>

<p>
    Besides rendering material assistance to the seminary our monasteries should commend its work to
    the Lord especially on the first Thursday of the month. Our brethren should always be mindful to
    the effect which their contact with students can have on their formation and should be careful,
    therefore, to guard against anything which could negate the efforts of the teachers such as
    those things which could undermine the authority of the Superiors and teachers.
</p>

<h2 id="norm90">Norm 90</h2>

<p>
    Lecturers and professors should not be overburdened with such permanent duties as might impede
    them in their work of intellectual and spiritual formation. It is advisable for them to take up
    that type of work which is consonant with the needs of the Order in which they specialize
    cooperating with monasteries or with appropriate commissions together with their Pastoral
    Activities.
    Through this type of cooperation those who also have been entrusted with the formation of the
    younger generation by our Order, will be better able to come to experience the actual needs of
    our Community in order to be better able to prepare our students to meet those needs.
</p>


<h2 id="norm91">Norm 91</h2>

<p>
    There are various ways in which our students are able to give evidence for their gratitude for
    the special conditions created for them by the Order:
</p>

<ol class="alph">
    <li> To the extent that they are able, they assist by working in shrines, monasteries, and
        churches especially during vacation time or on the occasion of feast days or great
        solemnities. This type of work also gives them good practical pastoral experience;
    </li>
    <li> Giving evidence of their oneness with the Order by showing a loving and a caring attitude
        for the house of studies for various articles given them to use, various study helps, books
        and so forth which remain the property of the seminary;
    </li>
    <li> Although their basic obligation is to study, as necessity demands they should also engage
        in physical work, not only out of recreational motives but also out of due respect for work
        itself.
    </li>

</ol>

<h2 id="norm92">Norm 92</h2>

<p>
    The rector of the seminary is responsible for the uniform manner in which our students are
    trained. Consequently:
</p>

<ol class="alph">
    <li> He organises systematic meetings of students and professors. They should be of a
        pedagogical and instructional nature not only discussing the ongoing business of the
        seminary but also being of an informational character as regards actual problems in various
        interesting fields;
    </li>
    <li> He should meet at least once every six months with the seminarians at a general meeting for
        the purpose of discussing with them both studies and matters pertaining to their formation;
    </li>
    <li> He is always ready to consider suggestions and criticisms made on the part of lecturers and
        students as concern the life of the seminary. He should also meet for private discussions
        with each student at least once a year.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="norm93">Norm 93</h2>

<p>
    The prefect of seminarians is directly responsible for the religious and priestly formation of
    our students. Through conferences and other forms of the Word of God, he seeks to:
</p>

<ol class="alph">
    <li> Inoculate our students with a spirit of faithfulness to the mission of the Order deepening
        their familiarity with the Laws of our Community;
    </li>
    <li> He trains and assists in keeping monastic discipline both through personal dialogue and by
        means of chapters which take place with the seminarians once a month;
    </li>
    <li> He trains in the practice of active obedience by leading the students to accept mutual
        responsibility for their priestly, Religious Vocation. One example of this would be
        cooperation with the seminarians&#8217; council;
    </li>
    <li> He should show concern for their health and all those things which are part of daily
        living;
    </li>
    <li> He informs the Major Superior in writing at least twice a year regarding the students and
        their life in general.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="norm94">Norm 94</h2>

<p>
    The spiritual director serves the seminarians by helping them to form their conscience and
    teaching them self-development. He does this in the following ways:
</p>

<ol class="alph">
    <li> By demanding from each student a program of interior life assisting them to formulate such
        a program if necessary;
    </li>
    <li> By his constant presence in the seminary and by being accessible to the students for the
        purpose of either hearing confessions or personal conferences;
    </li>
    <li> He gives ascetical conferences and directs days of recollection.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    The spiritual director does not take part in formation councils in which the topic is a moral
    and intellectual evaluation of the students.
</p>

<h2 id="norm95">Norm 95</h2>

<p>
    Prefect of studies has as his responsibility the carrying out of the instruction of the Major
    Superior and the Rector, which pertain to studies. Consequently:
</p>

<ol class="alph">
    <li> Under the direction of the Rector he has charge of personnel both teachers and students;
    </li>
    <li> It is his duty to prepare the schedule of classes, examinations and to see to it that the
        schedule is adhered to;
    </li>
    <li> He is in charge of the secretariat of the seminary.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="norm96">Norm 96</h2>

<p>
    The following are some of the ways in which our students are able to express their love and
    sense of responsibility for the Church and the Order, which is preparing them for the
    priesthood:
</p>

<ol class="alph">
    <li> Giving themselves seriously to their basic obligation which is to acquire knowledge by
        taking an active part in the lectures, various scholastic exercises, pastoral exercises,
        promptly taking their examinations, seeing to it that their talents especially in their
        chosen fields are well developed with the permission of the Rector;
    </li>
    <li> Seeing to it that they form a right conscience according to the Gospel, the Magisterium of
        the Church and the Order&#8217;s law. All of this will prepare them for undertaking the
        responsibility of serving the people of God;
    </li>
    <li> By learning, what it is to live a common life. Expression of this are a feeling of being
        responsible for the enter Community and each of its Brothers, a sense of solidarity in doing
        good and taking part in creative works together with Superiors and the student body.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="norm97">Norm 97</h2>

<p>
    Our students should experience the fullness of their unity with the Church by taking part in the
    Sacred Liturgy:
</p>

<ol class="alph">
    <li> Seminarians in Solemn Vows have the obligation of the Liturgy of the Hours. The remaining
        members of Community recite each day Lauds and Compline.
    </li>
    <li> All should make every effort possible to especially prepare themselves for the Sunday
        liturgy in which the Church experiences in the fullest way its oneness with the risen
        Christ. Such preparation takes expression or consists of meditating on the text of Holy
        Scripture, studying the ceremonies of the liturgy and taking care to implement these rubrics
        carefully;
    </li>
    <li> Under the direction of the Prefect, seminarians should experience different forms of
        liturgy so that they might be able to deepen their participation in it thereby avoiding
        fatal routine.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="norm98">Norm 98</h2>

<p>
    Conscious of their special loving union as members of the Pauline family with Mary our students
    should:
</p>

<ol class="alph">
    <li> Imitate the most Holy Mother in Her total surrender to God;</li>
    <li> Together with the whole Order they observe those days which are especially dedicated to Her
        taking care that each Saturday be characterised by special devotions to Her. Special
        observance is given to the patronal feast of the Immaculate Conception;
    </li>
    <li> They should eagerly take up the study of Mariology not only under the framework of lectures
        but on their own as well. They should become familiar both with traditional and new forms of
        devotion to Mary. Not hesitating to accept those, which are most consistent with the
        teaching Magisterium of the Church and are most suitable to present day conditions.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="norm99">Norm 99</h2>

<p>
    Seminarians are to give their Prefect a quarterly report regarding the following:
</p>

<ol class="alph">
    <li> The state of their health;</li>
    <li> The way in which they fulfil the daily spiritual and devotional exercises;</li>
    <li> An accounting regarding the keeping of the seminary rule, monastic law and the duties of
        their state of life as students;
    </li>
    <li> They should discuss the hardships of religious life and seek assistance or explanation in
        these matters;
    </li>
    <li> After holidays they should give a report as to how their time was spent;</li>
</ol>

<p>
    A similar report should be made regarding their Pastoral practice. Students are able to set
    forth their own suggestions, which in their opinion could improve the life of the seminary and
    perhaps even better the life of the Order.
</p>

<h2 id="norm100">Norm 100</h2>

<p>
    At the discretion of the Major Superior, our students may be permitted in the course of the year
    to spend some time with their families. This is done in order to:
</p>

<ol class="alph">
    <li> Promote family life;</li>
    <li> Be representatives of the Order in the immediate environment;</li>
    <li> Come to appreciate those values associated with the priesthood, which are so very necessary
        and respected by people today.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    While they are away from the seminary, they should pay close attention to Pastoral methods that
    seem to be most effectively used by the priests with whom they come in contact. They should be
    most willing to assist in Pastoral ministry.
