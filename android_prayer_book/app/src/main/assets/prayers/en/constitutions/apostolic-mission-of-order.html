<h1 class="index">Chapter V: The Apostolic Mission of the Order</h1>


<h2 id="art47">Article 47</h2>

<p>
    From its very beginnings the <span index="Pauline Order">Pauline Order</span> has always carried on <span index="Apostolic Mission">Apostolic Works</span>. This was
    principally expressed in our earliest days through the giving of witness, through instruction,
    and through a life of <span index="Prayer">prayer</span>. With the passage of time, according to the will of the Church, the
    Order assumed apostolic works. This included everything from the preaching of the <span index="Sacred Scripture">Word of God</span>
    and administration of the <span index="Sacrament">Sacraments</span> in our <span index="Church Building">Churches</span>, to <span index="Mission">mission</span> undertakings as well as academic
    endeavours. This testifies to the sensitivity of our <span index="Pauline Community">Pauline Community</span> to the real needs of
    God&#8217;s people and to the signs of the times. Conscious, therefore, of the character and spirit of
    the Order, we continue to join <span index="Contemplation">contemplation</span>, the apostolate of witness and <span index="Prayer">prayer</span> with works of
    active <span index="Ministry">ministry</span>.
</p>


<h2 id="art48">Article 48</h2>

<p>
    Each one of us through <span index="Sacrament!Baptism">Baptism</span> and <span index="Sacrament!Confirmation">Confirmation</span> participates in the saving work of Christ and
    this is the first title of our apostolate in the Church. Furthermore, with this new title of
    <span index="Religious Profession">religious profession</span>, we undertake the apostolic mission, by giving ourselves to the service of
    the Church. In a particular way, for this apostolic mission are responsible those who through
    Holy Orders participate in the priesthood of Christ.
</p>
<p>
    Consequently, not only the <span index="Priesthood">Priests</span> but also our Order&#8217;s <span index="Brothers">brothers</span> as well, must be mindful that
    they are joined together in the universal priesthood of the faithful and they have the ability
    and obligation to strengthen and to extend the Kingdom of God. Let each one be convinced that
    through his Evangelical manner of living, through <span index="Prayer">prayer</span>, <span index="Sacrifice">sacrifice</span> and work, and most
    especially by fulfilling the <span index="God's Will">Will of the Father</span> and the bearing of His crosses, this Apostolate
    becomes visible and effective.
</p>

<h2 id="art49">Article 49</h2>

<p>
    <span index="Preaching">Preaching</span> the <span index="Sacred Scripture">Word of God</span> is regarded as our first apostolic duty. In undertaking the Ministry
    of Preaching we must be aware that it constitutes the very basis for building up in faith (Rom
    10:17). It is a call in the name of God to conversion, it leads to the sacraments as the font of
    Divine Grace, it builds in the hearts of men and among them the Kingdom of God&#8217;s Grace and Life,
    it serves as the torch of truth and as the signpost on our pilgrimage to the Heavenly Father.
</p>
<p>
    The is why our <span index="Pristhood">priests</span>, enlivened by the Spirit of God and care for the spiritual welfare of his
    People, with zeal, will preach to all the mystery of Christ. They will explain and announce His
    teachings and with the their personal lives will confess, that which they preach. Let <span index="Mary">Our Lady,
    the Mother of Our Lord and our Mother</span>, be ever present in our preaching, like she is present in
    the teaching of the <span index="Church">Church</span> and in the <span index="Gospel">Gospels</span>.
</p>
<p>
    To preach to religious in their churches or chapel, permission is always required from the <span index="Prior">Prior</span>
    of the Monastery. (cf: Can. 765)
</p>

<h2 id="art50">Article 50</h2>

<p>
    Following the example of <span index="Mary">Mary</span>, our <span index="Preaching">preachers</span> must be diligent in giving themselves to study so
    that they might experience within themselves the eternal and always living truth of the <span index="Gospel">Gospel</span>
    expressed in the light of the Church&#8217;s teaching and according to the actual conditions of life.
    They should be conscious of the fact that their preaching must be geared to people who live in
    concrete situations. This includes those who come to our <span index="Shrine">Shrines</span> and <span index="Church Building">Churches</span> or who have come
    under our parochial care, as well as those whom we meet through different forms of <span index="Apostolate">Apostolate</span>
    such as <span index="Pilgrimages">pilgrimages</span>, <span index="Retreats">retreats</span>, days of recollections, conferences, etc.
</p>

<h2 id="art51">Article 51</h2>

<p>
    The Word of Christ which we preach to God&#8217;s people makes fruitful and effective their
    sacramental life.
</p>
<p>
    As Pauline Ministers of the <span index="Sacrament">Sacraments</span>, we must exert unceasing care to
    practice in our lives that which we celebrate. In this way we will show forth our likeness to
    Christ who manifests Himself through the Sacraments.
</p>
<p>
    Each pastoral setting committed to our care
    must be characterised by an ordered sacramental life and by the use of proper <span index="Liturgy">liturgical</span> forms,
    according to the precepts and the needs of the <span index="Church">Church</span>.
</p>


<h2 id="art52">Article 52</h2>

<p>
    The building up of the Community of the people of God is brought about most intensively through
    the Holy <span index="Eucharist">Eucharist</span>. Let it be the grave concern of all Pauline <span index="Priesthood">Priests</span> that which they and the
    people of God offer in faith and love should be joined to the richness and exalted Holiness of
    the Sacrifice of Christ and that of the whole Church. They should lead all the faithful to an
    ever fuller sharing in the Paschal Mystery through <span index="Preaching">homilies</span>, teachings and their very manner of
    celebrating. It is thanks to such ministry that the faithful will be able to draw from the
    Eucharistic light and strength for living out their Christian calling.
</p>


<h2 id="art53">Article 53</h2>

<p>
    From time immemorial the celebration of the <span index="Sacrament!of Penance">sacrament of Penance</span> has been for the Pauline
    Community one of our <em>principal <span index="Priesthood">priestly</span> occupations</em>. This is especially true of our
    <span index="Mary">Marian</span> <span index="Shrine">Shrines</span> where so many of the faithful gather, led there by a burning spiritual thirst for
    rebirth through the intercession of the Mother of Divine Grace.
</p>
<p>
    Each of our Fathers must be willing and ready to serve these penitents with the willingness of
    the forgiving Christ. They must make <em>every effort</em> to understand the penitent and to
    assist him on the difficult road to conversion.
</p>

<h2 id="art54">Article 54</h2>

<p>
    Our Priests, who so often find themselves in need of cleansing through the Sacrament of Penance,
    serve others by the power and in the person of Christ. In this way, Christ brings about the
    rebirth of sinners in His own Blood. Our Priests together with the penitents must deplore
    offenses against God; however, they must also be sympathetic to the plights of the sinner. Let
    them take care to lead such a one to repentance and mediate forgiveness in the name of the
    Merciful Father as they unite the sinner with the Church &#8211; that Church wounded by sin.
</p>
<p>
    It is the obligation of all our Fathers, through prayer and study, to acquire a deeper knowledge
    of human nature so that they might better assist the penitents in understanding and forming
    their own conscience in the spirit of the Gospels.
</p>


<h2 id="art55">Article 55</h2>

<p>
    In all places of Pastoral Care committed to our Order, but most especially in the Marian
    Shrines, care should be taken to provide quality Pastoral care. To this end:
</p>

<ol>
    <li> There is to be created within the General Curia a Pastoral Council as an advisory organ to
        the Superior General directed by one of his Definitors. It belongs to this Council to create
        and coordinate as well as to plan the Pastoral Activity of the Order.
    </li>
    <li> The Marian Shrines, which by Divine Providence have been entrusted to us, must be shown
        special concern by all members and governing members of the Order.
    </li>
    <li> In all our Houses, which have, appropriate facilities there should be created centres of
        recollection both for priests and for laity.
    </li>


</ol>

<h2 id="art56">Article 56</h2>


<ol>
    <li> Parishes under the care of the Order should be so directed that they might become centres
        of model Apostolic Work in their respective dioceses. They can also become for our Priests a
        school for Pastoral Ministry.
    </li>
    <li> All Monks assigned either to parishes or rectorates are obliged to cooperate actively in
        pastoral ministry with either the Parish Priest or rector.
    </li>

</ol>

<h2 id="art57">Article 57</h2>

<p>
    Concerned as we are above all for Pastoral Ministry within our Shrines and other places of
    activity, we must eagerly assist both diocesan and religious communities through the Ministry of
    Preaching, the administration of the Sacrament of Penance, as well as through other forms of
    service with the permission of the Superiors, precedence should be given to various forms of the
    Marian Apostolate.
</p>

<h2 id="art58">Article 58</h2>

<p>
    To better fulfil their Apostolic Ministry our Monks are allowed to take advantage of all forms
    of mass media always, however, within the bounds of prudence and with the permission of the
    Superiors. The Order furthermore, within the limits of its ability, should take care to create
    centres for publishing.
</p>
<p>
    The permission of the Superior General or Provincial is required before any member of the Order
    proceeds with the publication of any material of a religious or moral nature. (cf: Can. 832)
</p>

<h2 id="art59">Article 59</h2>

<p>
    Apostolic zeal, inspired by the Holy Spirit and sensitive to the signs of the times, urges us to
    dedicate our energies and talents for God and people. Encouraged by this we undertake new
    initiatives in the service of the Church and those peoples among whom we come to live and work.
    We should never fear the use of new forms, means, or apostolic methods providing they be
    employed under the direction of our Superiors.
