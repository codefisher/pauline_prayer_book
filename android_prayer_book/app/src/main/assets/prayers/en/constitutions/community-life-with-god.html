<h1 class="index">Chapter III: The Community in its Life with God</h1>

<h2 class="index">Liturgical Life</h2>

<h2 id="norm16">Norm 16</h2>

<p>
    <span index="Mass">Mass</span>, which makes present the Paschal Mystery of Christ, is the centre of the life of each
    Community and the most important event of each day. Consequently, it should be celebrated with
    faith and charity especially in all houses of formation.
</p>

<h2 id="norm17">Norm 17</h2>

<p>
    In all our Houses, a <span index="Conventual Mass">Conventual Mass</span> should be celebrated at a convenient time. Insofar as
    possible, it should be concelebrated unless this is precluded by other pastoral obligations. All
    members of the Community who are not prevented from doing so for serious reason should take part
    in Conventual Mass.
</p>

<h2 id="norm18">Norm 18</h2>

<p>
    Since Mass is the Mystery of the Divine Sacrifice and a source of unity, all major celebrations
    in the life of the Community should be joined with its celebration. This would include
    <span index="Religious Profession">Professions of Vows</span>, <span index="Vows">renewal of vows</span>, jubilees, the administration of the Sacrament of the
    <span index="Sacrament!of the Sick">anointing of the sick</span>, etc.
</p>

<h2 id="norm19">Norm 19</h2>

<p>
    The priests of our Order are bound to celebrate Holy Mass for the <span index="Mass Intentions">intentions</span>, which are
    designated for them by the <span index="Superior">Superior</span>. Once a month, they are allowed to celebrate mass for their
    own intentions. It is forbidden, however, to receive any manner of stipends for these Masses.
</p>
<p>
    <span index="Brothers">Brothers</span> are entitled to have Mass celebrated for their intentions on their feast day as well as
    two Masses during the course of the year. Should there be a special need, they may ask the <span index="Prior">Prior</span>
    to have Mass celebrated for their intention and he should accede to their wishes willingly.
</p>

<h2 id="norm20">Norm 20</h2>

<p>
    At the shrine at Jasna Gora one Mass in honour of the Mother of God should be celebrated each
    day (Normally a sung Mass) for the intentions of the Order.
</p>
<p>
    On the Solemnity of <span index="St. Paul the First Hermit">St. Paul the First Hermit</span>, Mass should be celebrated in each of our Houses
    for the intentions of the Community and the entire <span index="Order">Order</span>.
</p>

<h2 id="norm21">Norm 21</h2>

<p>
    In our larger monasteries, the <span index="Superior">Superior</span> should name a cantor and a <span index="Master of Ceremonies">Master of Ceremonies</span> who will
    be responsible for the proper execution of the liturgy. It is their responsibility to see that
    the Sacred <span index="Liturgy">Liturgy</span> and accompanying chants are celebrated on a high and worthy level. To bring
    this about they should schedule rehearsals for singing and for ceremonies. They should include
    in the service of the Holy Altar not only members of the Community but lay people as well. The
    Priest who is assigned to celebrate Holy Mass should prepare to do this in a worthy manner.
</p>

<h2 id="norm22">Norm 22</h2>

<p>
    With proper preparation our Monks should celebrate the <span index="Sacrament!of Penance">Sacrament of Penance</span> at least once every
    two weeks. Insofar as possible they should choose for themselves a permanent confessor so that
    they might take advantage of spiritual direction and make sure of progress on the road to
    perfect charity. Should Superiors notice that someone is neglecting the reception of the
    Sacrament of Penance, they should in a discreet and delicate manner bring this to their
    attention and encourage such a one to more zealous efforts in taking advantage of his gift of
    grace.
</p>

<h2 id="norm23">Norm 23</h2>

<p>
    For the greater glory of God and in order to strengthen the fraternal bonds of <span index="Pauline Community">Community</span>, it is
    important that the <span index="Liturgy of the Hours">Liturgy of the Hours</span> be celebrated worthily, attentively and devoutly. This
    should be the case even in those Houses where there would be only two members, as long as there
    is no reason to prevent them from doing this.
</p>
<p>
    All members of the Monastery are bound to the celebration of the Liturgy of the Hours, Priests,
    Seminarians, Brothers and Novices.
</p>
<p>
    The Conventual Chapter decides on the time for the celebration of the Liturgy of the Hours
    taking into consideration the proper time of the day for each of these Hours.
</p>


<h2 id="norm24">Norm 24</h2>

<p>
    Responsibility for the proper execution of the Liturgy of the Hours lies with the <span index="Subprior">Subprior</span> and
    <span index="Cantor">Cantor</span>.
</p>
<p>
    Monks in Solemn Profession should celebrate in choir or for sufficient reason, privately: the
    Office of Readings, Lauds, one of the Hours of the day, Vespers and Compline.
</p>
<p>
    On the greater solemnities, especially those celebrated in the Order but not precluding other
    days of the year the liturgy of the Hours should be either sung or recited with the people of
    God in our Churches.
</p>


<h2 id="norm25">Norm 25</h2>

<p>
    In individual circumstances and for a serious reason the <span index="Prior">Prior</span> is able to dispense from
    celebration of the <span index="Liturgy of the Hours">Liturgy of the Hours</span>. He can do this insofar as a Major Superior authorizes
    him.
</p>
<h2 class="index">The Life of Prayer</h2>

<h2 id="norm26">Norm 26</h2>

<p>
    Prayer is the basic characteristic of Pauline <span index="Spirituality">spirituality</span>. As a result, we fulfil this
    obligation of our calling always mindful of the presence of God. In making proper use of the
    time at our disposal which always gives priority to personal <span index="Prayer">prayer</span>, especially prayer in the
    presence of <span index="Christ">Christ our Lord</span>, present for us in the most <span index="Eucharist">Holy Sacrament</span>. Superiors and all our
    monks, mindful of the importance of prayer for one&#8217;s personal spiritual life as well as for the
    living out of the <span index="Mission">mission of the Order</span>, should make every effort to curb all unnecessary
    activity in order not hamper its development.
</p>


<h2 id="norm27">Norm 27</h2>

<p>
    During <span index="Adoration">adoration</span> of the most <span index="Eucharist">Blessed Sacrament</span> after lunch and during Compline some time should
    be spent in making an examination of conscience. All should make good use of this very important
    means of making spiritual progress. By doing so we are able to judge our actions in the light of
    Christ&#8217;s teaching thereby renewing our own intention and attitude to be more faithful in living
    out His demands.
</p>

<h2 id="norm28">Norm 28</h2>

<p>
    The annual six day <span index="Retreat">retreat</span> is a very important means for deepening one&#8217;s interior life as well
    as sanctifying the entire <span index="Pauline Community">Pauline Community</span>.
</p>
<p>
    The Major Superior is responsible for organizing
    the retreat. He also has authority to give permission for the making of private retreats.
    Individual houses are authorised to arrange common retreat for their members having notified the
    <span index="Superior!Major">Major Superior</span>.
</p>

<h2 id="norm29">Norm 29</h2>

<p>
    All members of the Community are responsible for creating an atmosphere of recollection and
    <span index="Silence">silence</span>. Special care should be taken that this atmosphere of recollection obtain in all places
    of prayer, in the <span index="Sacristy">sacristy</span>, in the corridors and in the area of individual rooms. Times for
    recreation, silence and a <span index="Silence!Grand">grand silence</span> at night should be designated in the &#8220;regimen&#8221; of each
    house. In making use of radio and/or television, we do so careful not to disturb the
    recollection of our brethren. Both radio and television should be silenced as of ten p.m., which
    is the Normal hour for retiring. Should there be any reason to talk after this time it should be
    done in a subdued voice.
</p>
<p>
    Through the observance of monastic silence, quiet and recollection we are better able to hear
    the voice of God speaking to our conscience strengthening us to a greater faithfulness in
    meeting the demands of that love which has been poured forth in our hearts by the Holy Spirit.
</p>

<h2 id="norm30">Norm 30</h2>

<p>
    Each day we spend time in <span index="Adoration">adoration</span> before the <span index="Eucharist">Blessed Sacrament</span> after lunch and again after
    supper. At least 15 minutes should be spent in spiritual reading.
</p>
<p>
    Three times each day, we recite the Angelus in order to give reverence to the mystery of the
    Incarnation and to thank <span index="Mary">Our Lady</span> for her protection over our Order.
</p>
<p>
    Each Saturday if the
    rubrics so allow, we celebrate a votive Mass of the Blessed Virgin Mary and we honour her in the
    Liturgy of the Hours. On Mondays we celebrate the Votive Mass of St. Paul the First Hermit, on
    Tuesdays that of the Holy Angels. Each Friday during Lent, we take part in the devotion of the
    <span index="Way of the Cross">Way of the Cross</span>.
</p>
<p>
    The Feast of Pentecost as well as the Solemnity of our <span index="St. Paul the First Hermit">Holy Patriarch</span> should be preceded by a
    novena observed according to the tradition of the Order.
    In accordance with local custom, we also celebrate a novena before one of the principle
    solemnities of the <span index="Mary">Mother of God</span>.
</p>

<h2 class="index">Our Life with Christ through Sacrifice</h2>

<h2 id="norm31">Norm 31</h2>

<p>
    Being mindful of the meaning of <span index="Sacrifice">sacrifice</span> and <span index="Penance">penance</span> we observe certain ancient as well as new
    forms of penance during the time of Advent, <span index="Lent">Lent</span>, as well as in preparation for <span index="Religious Profession">Religious
    Profession</span>, ordination, on the vigil of <span index="St. Paul the First Hermit">St. Paul the First Hermit</span>.
</p>


<h2 id="norm32">Norm 32</h2>

<p>
    Beside those occasions which the common life and a faithful living out of the evangelical
    counsels leads us to, we should undertake willingly certain practices of penance among which
    are:
</p>

<ol class="alph">
    <li> A longer period of adoration of the Blessed Sacrament even during the night, on the first
        Thursday of the month, on Holy Thursday, Good Friday, and New year&#8217;s eve. These vigils may
        be included as part of our pastoral ministry.
    </li>
    <li> Making the Way of the Cross especially on Fridays as an expression of our union with the
        suffering Christ offering this for the salvation of the world.
    </li>
    <li> A stricter observance of silence and quiet during those days or times of the day which are
        designated for this in each Monastery.
    </li>
    <li> Helping a confrere with his work or volunteering to do housework or working with the
        sick.
    </li>
    <li> Willingly undertaking fasting or abstinence, prostrating in the form of a cross in one&#8217;s
        room, private use of the discipline, putting up with various inconveniences.
    </li>
    <li> A patient and conscientious undertaking of additional work especially in hearing
        confessions.
    </li>
    <li> Giving up one&#8217;s free day or foregoing the recreations, all legitimate pleasure which modern
        civilizations afford such as watching televisions, movies, use of radios, trips etc.
    </li>
    <li> Other forms of penance according to the inspirations of grace and the individual needs of
        the Monk himself.
    </li>

</ol>

<h2 id="norm33">Norm 33</h2>

<p>
    Mindful of the modern tragedy of alcoholism and drug abuse and keeping in mind our obligation to
    raise the moral level of society our goal should be complete abstinence from alcohol both as
    individuals and as a Community.
</p>
<p>
    In our Order as a rule smoking is forbidden. All who have this habit are encouraged to give it
    up. It is absolutely forbidden to smoke in all common rooms.
</p>
<p>
    Those who are in charge of forming our youth are especially reminded to do all in their power to
    eliminate the habit of smoking.
</p>

<h2 id="norm34">Norm 34</h2>

<p>
    Our Monastic Communities should give a collective witness as to a life of penance, mortification
    and renunciation for the good of the Church as well as for the good of neighbor especially those
    families which have many children. We give this type of witness by giving up fancy meals as well
    as by observing meatless days and the donation of materials which are not really necessary in
    order to help older people. This witness can also be given by various activities undertaken by
    the entire Community either within or outside the Monastery.
</p>
<p>
    Each individual Community should determine other collective practices of penance for themselves.
</p>

<h2 id="norm35">Norm 35</h2>

<p>
    Justice and poverty demand that any confrere who has brought harm in the Order through
    negligence or thoughtlessness should undertake by himself additional acts of penance and
    mortifications.
