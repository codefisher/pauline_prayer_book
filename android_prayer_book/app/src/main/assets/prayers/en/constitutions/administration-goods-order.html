<h1 class="index">Chapter VI: The Administration of the Goods of the Order, Its Provinces and
    Monasteries</h1>


<h2 id="art161">Article 161</h2>

<p>
    We show respect for the material goods of the Order since in them we recognize the gift of God
    and the care of His Mother. In gratitude to God our Benefactor, we strive to use these goods in
    a spirit of poverty and responsibility so that we might further the ends of our calling (G.S.
    37), and provide for the needs of the Church and the poor. Common ownership of material goods
    serve to further the bond of mutual charity. As we make use of these goods in the spirit of the
    Gospel we are able both individually and collectively to give witness as to the priority of
    eternal goods and in this way we are able to preach Christ to the poor.
</p>


<h2 id="art162">Article 162</h2>


<ol>
    <li> The entire Community is responsible for the state, development, and use of the goods of the
        Order, its Provinces, and our individual Houses. our use of these goods should be
        characterized by diligence, good management and thrift.
    </li>

    <li><p>In the administration of goods, administrative acts should be distinguished as either
        ordinary or extraordinary acts&#8230;</p>
        <p>
            Ordinary administrative acts are those, which have to do with the maintenance, ongoing
            renovation and the yearly activities of the community. They remain in the competency of
            the local superior and his council.
        </p>
        <p>
            Extraordinary administrative acts are for example: major repairs, construction,
            extraordinary purchases. They require a written request of the superior of the house as
            well as the consent of his council as well as written permission of the higher superior,
            after having received the consent of his council. Otherwise, these acts are invalid.
            (Can. 1281&#167; 2).
        </p>
    </li>

    <li> Alienation exceeding the maximum amount allowed by the Apostolic See for one&#8217;s country
        demands the permission of the Holy See. The permission of the Holy See is also required in
        those matters pertaining to very costly items due to their being made of precious material
        or having artistic valve or historical value especially votive offerings of great value
        which have been given to the Church (Can. 1292, &#167;. 2).
    </li>

    <li> A Monk who wilfully contracts concerning personal goods must answer for any damaging
        results occurring because of this. The community is absolved of any such responsibility. In
        such a case the Superiors and Community may take legal action against the one guilty (Can.
        639, &#167; 3 &amp; 4).
    </li>

    <li id="art162-5"> In planning and carrying out more costly capital expenditures as regards renovating or
        giving mutual assistance all governing bodies are first to consult with the
        administrator-general and must obtain all those permissions called for by law.
    </li>

</ol>

<h2 id="art163">Article 163</h2>

<p>
    Each monastery must keep an inventory of moveable and immovable goods especially those of a
    precious nature. A copy of this inventory should be preserved in either the Provincial or
    General Curia of the Order. The inventory should be updated at any changes noted therein should
    be brought to the attention of the Major Superiors each year. It should be made available for
    inspection by the Visitator. The Prior upon taking leave of his office should entrust it to his
    successor.
</p>


<h2 id="art164">Article 164</h2>

<p>
    All income and expenses of our Monasteries, Provinces and the Order itself should be carefully
    recorded and supervised. The general officers decide as to the manner in which they will be
    invested as well as to the manner of keeping books and supervising. The Major Superior is
    responsible for carrying out these instructions.
</p>

<h2 class="index">Administrator</h2>

<h2 id="art165">Article 165</h2>

<p>
    The Administrator of the Monastery has the responsibility for organizing the material means
    which make for the efficient functioning of the Community. The spiritual good of the Community
    demand that the Prior should not busy himself directly with material matters.
</p>
<p>
    The Major Superior chooses the Administrator after consultation with the Prior of the given
    Monastery.
</p>

<h2 id="art166">Article 166</h2>

<p>
    The Administrator takes as his model Martha in her concern for Christ Himself in offering a
    service of self-sacrifice thereby giving his brethren a greater freedom in working for the
    salvation of God&#8217;s people.
</p>
<p>
    The Administrator should concern himself with the best possible and sensible utilisation of the
    goods of the monastery and in taking care of the basic material needs of his brethren. He takes
    care of renovation to the monastery buildings and the preservations of monuments. He undertakes
    major capital expenditures only with the permission of the Prior and the Council. He reports to
    them regarding his administration, the state of the Monastery treasury and the keeping of books.
    In important matters he consults with the Administrator-General in consultation with the Prior
    of the House (<a href="administration-goods-order.html#art162-5" ebook="ebook">Art. 162, &#167; 5</a>).
</p>


<h2 id="art167">Article 167</h2>

<p>
    Assisting in the proper functioning of the monastery are workers who fill in various positions.
    In making contracts with them, the Administrator should be guided by principals of justice and
    equity. So that their compensation should assure them support demanded by human dignity enabling
    them to meet their family obligations. He should take into account their experience as well as
    their demands of civil law. In the event that he must dismiss a worker, he should do everything
    demanded by good judgment so that this same worker would have no grounds for considering himself
    as being wronged.
</p>


<h2 id="art168">Article 168</h2>

<p>
    The special obligations of the Administrator demand that he be constantly concerned about
    improving his administrative qualification. Although his obligations often make it difficult for
    him to take part in the life of the Community he should nonetheless according to his means take
    part in common prayer, meals and recreation. He has the right to the gratitude of his brothers
    but when he is met with ingratitude let him take comfort in the thought that his reward is that
    of the good steward of the Gospel that of the Lord himself.
