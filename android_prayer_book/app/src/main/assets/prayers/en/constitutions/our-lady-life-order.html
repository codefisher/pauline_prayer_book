<h1 class="index">Chapter VI: Our Lady in the Life of the Order</h1>


<h2 id="art60">Article 60</h2>

<p>
    From its very beginnings, our Order has enjoyed the special assistance of Our Lady. She has
    always been present in the life and activity of the Pauline Community. Our Order has always
    honoured her as Mother, Lady, and Queen and has striven zealously to propagate this devotion.
</p>
<p>
    It is our conviction that in the course of some very turbulent history associated with our Order
    (of which there is no lack), the protection of Mary has been a support in striving for holiness
    and making effective our mission to those peoples to whom Divine Providence sent us.
</p>

<p>
    Because of this with complete confidence, we inextricably bind ourselves to Mary for the future,
    through a son-like love and through a desire to imitate her faithfulness to God. Furthermore, we
    pledge ourselves to be preachers of her greatness wherever we can, extolling her participation
    in the saving work of Christ and Her union in the Holy Spirit.
</p>

<h2 id="art61">Article 61</h2>

<p>
    Our devotion to the Most Holy Virgin is based on the Gospels and the teaching of the Church. We
    use as examples her zealous and devoted servants and those &#8220;staunch friends of the Mother of
    God&#8221; in the annals of our Order.
</p>
<p>
    Together with the Church which fixes its attention upon the Mystery of Mary&#8217;s holiness, (cf: LG
    64) we seek to imitate her virtues and we venerate her through the Liturgy. We strive to
    celebrate her feasts with devotion and to practice Marian piety on a deeper level which has been
    hallowed by Tradition and approved by the Church. One special form of such devotion is the Holy
    Rosary. We are willing to make use of even the most binding forms of devotion even to the extent
    of make Total Consecration to her.
</p>


<h2 id="art62">Article 62</h2>

<p>
    Jasna Gora and other Marian Shrines, which play an important role in the spiritual formation of
    people, who derived so many Graces from these Shrines, constitute something of great value. They
    endow our Order with a special charisma as well as a serious mission within our ministry.
</p>
<p>
    In all centres of our Pastoral ministry and especially in our Shines, we must make every effort
    to present Mary as being joined in maternal love to Our Lord in the Holy Spirit. It is she who
    effectively calls the faithful to Her Son, to His Sacrifice and to the love of the Father. (PC.
    65)
</p>
<p>
    We may be sure that Marian sanctuaries and other places dedicated to Her, will be an unending
    source of the enrichening Graces of Salvation (LG 25) as long as we take care with zeal and a
    sense of responsibility to fulfil the obligations incumbent on us.
