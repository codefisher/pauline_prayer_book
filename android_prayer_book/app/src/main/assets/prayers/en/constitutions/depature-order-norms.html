<ol class="Alph">
    <li>
        <p>
            In those instances foreseen by law the process for dismissing a Monk in Solemn Vows
            should be initiated.
        </p>
        <p>This process demands the following elements:</p>
        <ol class="alph">
            <li> That the Major Superior gathers or supplements materials providing proof;</li>
            <li> That this same Superior gives the Monk either in writing or in the presence of two
                witnesses a reprimand which includes the threat of dismissal if there be no
                correction.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li> The Superior must clearly state the reasons for dismissal giving his confrere the
        opportunity to defend himself. If the reprimand proves fruitless than another canonical
        reprimand should be given after a period of at least fifteen days when the Major Superior in
        concert with his Council decides that even the second reprimand is without effect and the
        defence made by the offender is not sufficient. He is to gather all the documents containing
        the response of the Monk and after a period of fifteen days following the last reprimand is
        to send these same documents to the highest Superior (Can. 697. n. 3). The Father General
        presents the matter of dismissal of the Monk to the secret vote of the Council. Following
        this, in the event such a decision for dismissal is made he issues a decree of dismissal of
        the culprit from the Order.
    </li>
    <li> The validity of the decree requires:
        <ol class="alph">
            <li> A summary of both legal and factual reasons for the dismissal (Can. 669 n.1);</li>
            <li> The approval of the Holy See;</li>
            <li> The notation in the decree allowing the Monk to have resource to the Apostolic See
                within ten days (Can. 700).
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    Loss of active or passive voice takes place in accordance with the Norms of Canon Law. Over and
    above this, the General Chapter or the General Administration may also delineate examples of
    transgressions that would merit this punishment. They are also authorised to impose such a
    punishment.
</p>

<h2 id="norm208">Norm 208</h2>

<p>
    Repeated serious transgressions that are repeated through stubbornness and without any visible
    signs of correction as well as frequently repeated indifference to living a common life, refusal
    to receive discipline and penance are sufficient reasons for dismissal from the Monastic family.
