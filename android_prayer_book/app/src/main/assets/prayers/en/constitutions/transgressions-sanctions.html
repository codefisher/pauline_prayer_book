<h1 class="index">Chapter IX: Transgressions and Sanctions</h1>


<h2 id="art178">Article 178</h2>

<p>
    God in His merciful justice calls for various sanctions imposed by way of punishment for sins
    committed. He does this for the purification and the perfection of the individual as well as in
    defence of holiness itself and the upkeep of the moral order.
</p>
<p>
    All sins makes light of one&#8217;s personal relationship with God and human beings, it lowers our
    human dignity; it disturbs the universal good order and brings harm to the whole human family.
    Through this God receives the glory due to Him.
</p>
<p>
    Mindful of this, our members should willingly undertake to do penance not only for faithlessness
    in their own personal lives as they live out their Vocation, but should accept in spirit of
    reparation those punishments which are meted to them by their Superiors as a way of making
    satisfaction to God and redressing the disturbed life of the Pauline Community.
</p>

<h2 id="art179">Article 179</h2>

<p>
    An attitude of negligence as regards the rules in our Constitutions or in the Directory or
    regarding orders given by competent authority weakens the bond of Community; it decreases its
    holiness and paralyzes its apostolic endeavours. The entire Community but especially Superiors
    must do their utmost to prevent this from happening. We do this by vigilant charity a prudent
    seriousness and decisiveness in the way we act.
</p>
<p>
    We should treat a Brother who freely admits his faults as a prodigal son-all in the spirit of
    the Gospel. As regards those who are discovered to be incorrigible, they must use admonitions
    and punishments to the extent that this is necessary.
</p>

<h2 id="art180">Article 180</h2>


<ol>
    <li>
        <p>
            In the spirit of responsibility for the good of their brethren in the case of more
            serious transgressions, monks should courageously and resolutely give admonition to
            such a one using at the same time discretion and charity.
            Should this admonition prove fruitless the matter should be referred to the Superior.
            If both a brotherly and fatherly admonition should again, over due course prove
            ineffective then the Superior should reprimand the guilty party publicly &#8211; this
            in the case of transgressions that are public.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the case of those who appear, incorrigible after consultation with the council or
            with two older members of the Community the Superior should assign an appropriate
            penance together with his admonition. Hopefully this will allow the guilty party to
            examine himself and to amend his wayward conduct.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>In case of necessity the Superior may use another member of the Community as an intermediary
        especially if the guilty party has special trust in this individual if the Superior foresees
        his admonition would be more effective.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="art181">Article 181</h2>

<p>
    In the case of persistent incorrigibility or transgressions which are not publicly known but
    which nonetheless are serious the Superior is to have recourse to the Major Superior so that
    through their intervention the erring brother might be brought back from spiritual harm as well
    as to prevent disgrace to the Order. The inflicting of punishments for serious transgressions of
    which Canon Law speaks belongs to the competency of Major Superiors.
</p>
<p>
    Those who subvert the life of the Community should be urged by Superiors and the entire
    Community to leave the Order.
