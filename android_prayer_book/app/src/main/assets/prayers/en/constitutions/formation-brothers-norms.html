<h1 class="index">Chapter V: The Formation of Brothers</h1>


<h2 id="norm107">Norm 107</h2>

<p>
    The juniorate for Brothers extends to the time of their Solemn Profession. A director of the
    juniorate uses a program which has been approved by the Major Superior.
</p>
<p>
    The Major Superior also designates suitable Houses in which solid formation can take place.
</p>


<h2 id="norm108">Norm 108</h2>

<p>
    It is the obligation of the director to see that those in the juniorate conscientiously fulfil
    their obligations and complete the designated program. He will send the Major Superior at least
    once every six months a report on each of the Brothers in which report he will address their
    progress in Religious Life, the state of their health, their effectiveness in working and their
    interests.
</p>

<h2 id="norm109">Norm 109</h2>

<p>
    After their Solemn Profession, Brothers are obliged to continue systematically their work in
    advancing the interior life as well as updating their own professional qualifications.
</p>

<p>
    If formation is to be uniform in all its stages, coordination of efforts and the use of proper
    methods are incumbent on all to whom the Order has entrusted the mission of training the young
    generation. A commission for matters pertaining to formation oversees this important task
    rendering assistance to the Major Superior in these matters. Its members include:
</p>

<ol class="alph">
    <li> The Rector of the seminary;</li>
    <li> Prefect of Seminarians</li>
    <li> The Master of Novices;</li>
    <li> The Director of vocations;</li>
    <li> The Director for the formation of Brothers and young Priests;</li>
    <li> The prefect of Postulants.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    The Major Superior names the Chairman of this commission and other members.
