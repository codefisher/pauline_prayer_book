Following this, in the event such a decision for dismissal is made he issues a decree of dismissal of the culprit from the Order.

Monasteries having at least ten Priests have the right to create their own council. If the number of Fathers in a given house allows for forming two or more such colleges consisting of at least ten members (this should be determined according to order and time of profession) each of these groups selects from among its number one delegate and one substitute.
