<h1 class="index">Chapter IV: The Community of the Monastery</h1>


<h2 id="norm156">Norm 156</h2>

<p>
    Each of our communities holds in common our mission. They differ, however, among themselves by
    virtue of the character, tradition and specific functions, which they both accept and preserve.
</p>
<p>
    We differentiate, therefore, in our Order outside of ordinary monasteries the following types of
    Houses, Novitiates and Houses of Religious formation; Houses of studies; Shrines: Parishes and
    Centre of Pastoral Ministry; Houses of Recollection: Houses given over to publishing and
    education; Houses of rest.
</p>


<h2 id="norm157">Norm 157</h2>

<p>
    On the occasion of erecting new monasteries the Major Superior should ascertain whether it will
    be possible and especially whether there is an actual need for our carrying out our particular
    from of Pastoral ministry while simultaneously determining suitable conditions for leading a
    religious life. He should take care of specific note of material conditions so that each of our
    monasteries might be independent as to its upkeep doing so through the work of its members and
    the contributions of the faithful.
</p>


<h2 id="norm158">Norm 158</h2>

<p>
    New centres of pastoral ministry should be provided with a sufficient number of Fathers and
    Brothers who distinguish themselves by monastic discipline, sense of initiative and
    organizations skills so that without any delay they might begin their Pastoral Ministry while
    waiting for the completion of the Monastery building and Church.
</p>
<p>
    Smaller Houses and Communities should also have sufficient membership to assure the leading of a
    Religious Life based on common prayer, mediation and the Liturgy of the Hours.
</p>


<h2 id="norm159">Norm 159</h2>

<p>
    Our churches should be built in such a fashion that their architecture and interior decoration
    might satisfy what function and beauty demand in Order to comply with liturgical precepts. Our
    monasteries should be built simply, in a practical style and furnished ascetically.
</p>

<h2 class="index">The Prior of the Monastery</h2>

<h2 id="norm160">Norm 160</h2>

<p>
    Upon taking office, the Prior should examine thoroughly the written report of his predecessor.
</p>
<p>
    This report should include the following:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>the state of the personnel of the Monastery,</li>
    <li>the moral state and the Monastic discipline of the Monastery;</li>
    <li>the Pastoral activity (be it educational, formational);</li>
    <li>the material state of the Monastery;</li>
</ul>

<p>
    and other points of informational such as;
</p>

<ol class="alph">
    <li> The agenda of the entire years&#8217; Pastoral and preaching activities in a given church as well
        as various Pastoral services rendered to other Churches.
    </li>
    <li> A book containing a list of the benefactors and friends of the Monastery;</li>
    <li> A report as to all renovation or construction projects which have been completed as well as
        a plan concerning those projects which demand attention in the near future;
    </li>
    <li> A list of permanent and part-time employees of the Monastery together with addresses and
        work contracts;
    </li>
    <li> Documentation which is both technical and constructional in nature concerning the Church
        and Monastery;
    </li>
    <li> Certificates of guarantee for those technical appliances which are found in the Monastery
        together with the instructions for their servicing;
    </li>
    <li> Documents and correspondence with civil and Church authorities;</li>
    <li> The chronicle of the Monastery together with possible photographic documentation;</li>
    <li> A book of minutes from meetings of the House Council and the Conventual Chapter;</li>
    <li> A book of Mass intentions, etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    The Major Superior or his Delegate present at the transfer of Office of the Superior, should
    check the contents of the report with the actual state of the house. On him rest, likewise, the
    responsibility of ensuring, that the above mentioned documentation is in face and in full given
    to the new Superior.
</p>

<h2 id="norm161">Norm 161</h2>

<p>
    Upon leaving office, the Prior should acquaint his successor with his new environment:
</p>
<p>
    He should introduce him to the local Bishop, Dean or Parish Priest and to those whose
    acquaintance will be useful in the execution of his responsibilities.
</p>


<h2 id="norm162">Norm 162</h2>

<p>
    Together with the entire community, the Prior should make every effort to create an atmosphere
    within the Monastery that would foster a life of prayer. He must see it that the Conventual Mass
    and Liturgy of the Hours are celebrated punctually, worthily, and with decorum, with all rules
    of recitation and choral rubrics being duly respected. He must see to it that no one is
    indifferent to the spiritual exercises.
</p>


<h2 id="norm163">Norm 163</h2>

<p>
    The Prior should reside within the Monastery but if for just reasons he must leave it he should
    inform the Subprior or if he is not present one of his councillors as to his destination and the
    length of his absence. He also gives him appropriate authority in governing the Monastery.
</p>

<h2 id="norm164">Norm 164</h2>

<p>
    The Superior will see to it that a conference is given once a month or in its place discussions
    on themes concerning Religious Life.
</p>
<p>
    Instructions issued by the Holy See or other proper Church or Religious authorities concerning
    Monks and especially regulating their Pastoral activity must be adhered to strictly.
</p>


<h2 id="norm165">Norm 165</h2>

<p>
    He should take care to relate with tact and charity to all persons to that they might be well
    disposed towards our Order so that at least some of these could be joined to our circle of
    friends and assistants in the apostolate.
</p>

<h2 id="norm166">Norm 166</h2>

<p>
    The Prior is likewise the Rector of the Church and is thus responsible for the level of Pastoral
    ministry. In our Parishes as a rule, the Prior also serves as Parish Priest.
</p>

<h2 id="norm167">Norm 167</h2>

<p>
    As regards confidential business of the monastery as well as those matters, which pertain to the
    weaker side of the brethren, he should maintain discretion even when dealing with Monks from our
    other houses. On the other hand, the Priors of our monasteries should willingly share among
    themselves the experiences and achievements both Pastoral and other wise. This is especially
    true of our shrines.
</p>

<h2 id="norm168">Norm 168</h2>

<p>
    The beginning of every year the Prior will send to the Major Superior a report of the preceding
    year as to the state of the Monastery according to a specific questionnaire.
</p>
<h2 class="index">The Subprior</h2>

<h2 id="norm169">Norm 169</h2>

<p>
    The Monk named to the office of Subprior should be one who is characterized both personally and
    morally with attributes which will assist in both building up and preserving a greater sense of
    unity as well as assisting in carrying out the mission of the community.
</p>

<h2 id="norm170">Norm 170</h2>

<p>
    The authority, which he exercises over the brethren, is that which is outlined in the
    Constitutions and in the Directory and as given him by the Prior. On the other hand, during the
    Prior&#8217;s absence he should not introduce any major changes.
</p>
<p>
    In any urgent cases when the Prior is not expected to return soon he may for a just reason
    convene a Conventual Chapter, notifying the Superior concerning the decisions made during it.
</p>

<h2 id="norm171">Norm 171</h2>

<p>
    Among their obligations of the Subprior or Subpriors are:
</p>

<ol class="alph">
    <li> To assist and to cooperate with the Prior in the governing of the Monastic House and to
        take care with the Master of Ceremonies and cantor that the quality of the Community&#8217;s
        liturgical life be on the highest level;
    </li>
    <li> To be in charge of the inventory of things both Monastic and belonging to the Church;</li>
    <li> Properly keeps up the chronicles of both the Church and Monastery;</li>
    <li> Forwards the information concerning the life and activity of the Community to the Order&#8217;s
        bulletin;
    </li>
    <li> To see to the reception and proper treatment of the guests;</li>
    <li> To take care of the sick with the assistance of the Infirmarian;</li>
    <li> To make entries into the necrology of deceased brethren and confraters.</li>

</ol>

<h2 class="index">The House Council</h2>

<h2 id="norm172">Norm 172</h2>

<p>
    The councillors should be individuals of the Community who are especially active in it and who
    understand its mission and its problems.
</p>
<p>
    The Superior should take advantage of their counsel. Should he be indifferent to their counsel
    or commit some other impropriety the council; should bring this to his attention a first and
    second time through the Subprior. If there is no sign of change, they should then present the
    matter to the Major Superior.
</p>

<h2 id="norm173">Norm 173</h2>

<p>
    The council decides the limit of how much money the Prior can assign for good works in any one
    month. He is forbidden to spend more money than that sum which has been determined by the
    meeting of the council without approval of that same council and in accordance with the
    Monastery&#8217;s budget and the needs of the Community.
</p>
<p>
    The above matters concern extraordinary administration, not that which is Normal and usual as
    regards expenditures for upkeep, conversation of buildings and the general management, etc.
</p>

<h2 id="norm174">Norm 174</h2>

<p>
    The Superior selects the Secretary of the council and besides keeping the minutes of meeting; he
    puts together the recommendations forthcoming from the deliberations and those proposals
    submitted by members of the Community, which are to be presented to the Conventual Chapter.
</p>

<h2 class="index">The Conventual Chapter</h2>

<h2 id="norm175">Norm 175</h2>

<p>
    Meeting of the Conventual Chapter should take place at least every three months under the
    leadership of the Prior or his substitute. In houses of study, Seminarians take part in the
    Chapter under the leadership of their Prefect. These Chapters begin by the reading of the Word
    of God or prayer. After the reading of the minutes of the preceding meeting, those matters under
    consideration should be discussed concisely and to the point keeping within the boundaries of
    sincere and cultural discussion. The Prior or the one who takes his place should supervise the
    whole discussion so that it might be fruitful, resulting in suitable recommendations.
</p>

<h2 id="norm176">Norm 176</h2>

<p>
    The scope of matters treated at meetings of the Chapter should be spelled out beforehand. The
    following are matters, which should be discussed at Chapter meetings:
</p>

<ol class="alph">
    <li> Prayer and Liturgical Life as well as an atmosphere of recollection and silence within the
        House;
    </li>
    <li> Problems concerning Pastoral ministry carried on in that House together with plans for the
        future and assurances to how these plans will be effectively executed;
    </li>
    <li> Current instructions given by component Superiors;</li>
    <li> Information concerning decisions made concerning the council of the House and updating with
        regards to work carried out by the administrator together with problems of the economy and
        necessary expenses;
    </li>
    <li> Requests made before hand to the Prior by individual members of the Community which have
        been submitted at least one day prior to the Chapter meeting;
    </li>
    <li> As an expression of their mutual responsibility for each other and for the whole Community
        the Conventual Chapter should on the one hand give acknowledgment for zeal and on the other
        hand if it be necessary meet out sanctions for those Monks who unjustly neglect their
        responsibilities or disturb the unity of the Community;
    </li>
    <li> Current business.</li>

</ol>

<h2 class="index">The Custodian</h2>

<h2 id="norm177">Norm 177</h2>

<p>
    A specific ministry of our Order is the work carried out in Marian Shrines. If the need arises a
    custodian or director for the Shrine should be appointed (in accordance with Art. 160, &#167;. 1)
    following the example of the Custodian at Jasna Gora.
</p>

<h2 id="norm178">Norm 178</h2>

<p>
    The Custodian as the closet co-worker to the Prior in the administration of the Jasna Gora
    Shrine is a member of the Pastoral Council of the Order. Despite the zeal of all the members of
    the Community in serving pilgrims, he does take advantage of assistance rendered by groups of
    specialists especially in the area of Pastoral ministry:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>The Sacred Liturgy</li>
    <li>The service of preaching the Word of God</li>
    <li>; the administration of the Sacrament of Penance;</li>
    <li>Marriage and family counselling;</li>
    <li>Guiding tours;</li>
    <li>Pastoral correspondence; and in serving various pilgrimages be they according to state of
        life, profession, foreigners, etc.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="norm179">Norm 179</h2>

<p>
    The Custodian has a steady substitute in the person of the Vice-Custodian who on his behalf
    takes charge of the office and Pastoral correspondence.
</p>
<p>
    The Prior names the Vice-Custodian and with the approval of his council in consultation with the
    Custodian.
</p>
<p>
    Each day at designated times a person on duty in the sacristy takes the place and assists the
    Custodian in his duties. The same person has his designated rights and duties.
</p>

<h2 id="norm180">Norm 180</h2>

<p>
    It is the Custodian&#8217;s responsibility to oversee the development of Marian devotion in the Shrine
    in accordance with the teaching of the Church and the national Pastoral program. His special
    concern is for Liturgical reverence for the Mother of God keeping in mind the specific character
    of the Jasna Gora Shrine.
</p>
<p>
    He organizes new forms of Marian devotion giving precedence to the Rosary.
</p>
<p>
    He should surround the miraculous icon of Our Lady of Jasna Gora with special care.
</p>
<p>
    He sees to the safekeeping of both the historical and current votive offerings, which have been
    made together with the testimonies given by the faithful attesting to the special intercession
    of the Mother of God. He will also prudently make this information available to our other
    pastoral Ministers as well as to pilgrims.
</p>


<h2 id="norm181">Norm 181</h2>

<p>
    During the time of pilgrimages, meetings and special feasts the Custodian should make every
    effort to organize the proper care of pilgrims, both clerical and lay. After consulting with the
    Prior, he should invite outstanding preachers as well as larger number of Priests for the
    hearing of confessions of the faithful.
</p>


<h2 id="norm182">Norm 182</h2>

<p>
    The Custodian concerns himself with the fulfilment of those obligations, which have been assumed
    regarding the faithful most especially as concern the time and the kinds of Masses to be
    celebrated.
</p>
<p>
    He turns over to the General Treasury all monetary offerings, which have been made. The
    Administrator pays the salaries of those workers employed by the Shrine. In consideration,
    however, of the necessary expenses which are connected with his own activities the Custodian is
    authorised to keep a separate treasury whose budget and supervision is determined by the House
    Council.
</p>


<h2 id="norm183">Norm 183</h2>

<p>
    Respected as an architectural aggregate Jasna Gora is considered a national, cultural treasure.
    For this reason the Custodian is concerned for its conservation acting in concert with the
    Prior, Administrator and Curator of art collections with the consent of the Major Superior.
    Never, however, does he undertake to make capital expenditure in this area on his own authority.
</p>
<p>
    Mindful of certain threats such as desecration of the Blessed Sacrament and sacred objects,
    theft, vandalism and fire, he should see to the proper protection of the Shrine.
</p>


<h2 id="norm184">Norm 184</h2>

<p>
    The Custodian or Director of the Shrine who is responsible for the Pastoral ministry connected
    with pilgrims and local faithful should so arrange the schedule of Masses that they might be
    able to easily take part consciously, actively and devoutly. Preachers should also be mindful of
    the needs of the faithful when executing their ministry.
</p>

<h2 class="index">The Sacristan</h2>

<h2 id="norm185">Norm 185</h2>

<p>
    The Brother Sacristan appointed by the Prior is concerned with the immediate good order of the
    House of God and especially of the smooth operation of all Liturgical functions for which he
    prepares everything that is necessary for worthy celebration.
</p>
<p>
    It is his responsibility to prepare suitable decorations before all the major feast days.
</p>


<h2 id="norm186">Norm 186</h2>

<p>
    The Sacristan must pay special attention to the proper and safe preservation of the most Blessed
    Sacrament. He should also remember to have the sacred species renewed, to give due respect to
    relics, to change the holy oils once a year and to see that they are properly preserved. He
    should also see to the proper upkeep of Liturgical vessels, books and vestments, pictures and
    other Church items taking care that they are not ruined, lost or stolen.
</p>
<p>
    In a special way, it is his responsibility for the safety of the House of God paying special
    attention to the Church doors, locks and lighting, both electric and natural (oil lamps and
    candles). He is also responsible for keeping an inventory of the Church treasury, its vestments,
    vessels and Church furnishings. A second copy remains with the Subprior and a third goes to the
    Church curia.
</p>

<h2 class="index">The Cantor and Master of Ceremonies</h2>

<h2 id="norm187">Norm 187</h2>

<p>
    The Cantor and Master of Ceremonies are appointed by the Prior and have the obligation of
    overseeing the proper celebration of Liturgy together with a sufficient preparation for the same
    by the Community. They should acquaint their brethren with the current rules of the Church and
    conduct suitable rehearsals especially before feast days.
</p>
<p>
    The Cantor leads in liturgical singing being concerned to uphold a high level of music and
    liturgical chant.
</p>
<p>
    The Master of Ceremonies is in charge of all those who play a liturgical role during all the
    ceremonies and is in charge of preparing suitable liturgical commentaries.
</p>

<h2 class="index">The Librarian</h2>

<h2 id="norm188">Norm 188</h2>

<p>
    The local Superior with the advice of the House Council appoints the Librarian.
</p>
<p>
    The Librarian is in charge of cataloguing together with making available all collections of
    books during appropriate hours of the day. He should employ all modern methods in his work
    taking into consideration the potential and needs of his Monastery. His willingness to be of
    service should influence the development of good reading habits in the Monastery. The Superior
    determines the Monies to be spent on the purchase of new books having consulted with the House
    Council.
</p>
<p>
    He makes the library available to individuals outside of the Order according to the thinking of
    his Superiors.
</p>
<p>
    Each of our monasteries should be suitably organised to include a reading room complete with
    reference aids and current periodicals.
</p>

<h2 class="index">The Infirmarian</h2>

<h2 id="norm189">Norm 189</h2>

<p>
    The Subprior is responsible for the care of the sick in the Monastery. In Communities having a
    greater number of members, the Prior should appoint a conscientious and suitably prepared
    Infirmarian to assist him. The obligations of the Infirmarian include the following:
</p>

<ol class="alph">
    <li> To administer first aid to those who need it;</li>
    <li> To inform the superior as to the illness and actual state of those who are sick;</li>
    <li> A conscientious service to the sick including visiting them in the hospital;</li>
    <li> Maintaining properly equipped medicine chest both in the house and in the sacristy.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    In each of our monasteries, our Brothers should be assured of ongoing, professional, and medical
    care.
</p>

<h2 class="index">The Porter</h2>

<h2 id="norm190">Norm 190</h2>

<p>
    The Porter is appointed by the Prior to represent the Community at the entrance to the
    Monastery. His obligation includes seeing to it that the cloister is not violated, receiving
    guests and those having business at the Monastery, serving both them and the Community with
    great conscientiousness.
</p>
<p>
    The Porter&#8217;s manner of bearing should manifest both a level of personal culture and a manner
    which bespeaks of prudence and good Monastic manners together with an Apostolic Spirit as is
    demanded by his responsibilities.
</p>
<p>
    He must keep in mind the safety of the Monastery and the proper service of those who have
    business within it. Consequently, he should never leave the door unattended. He is in charge of
