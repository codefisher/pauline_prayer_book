<h1 class="index">Chapter II: Formation during Novitiate</h1>


<h2 id="norm78">Norm 78</h2>

<p>
    It belongs to the Major Superior to confirm the instruction for the novitiate regarding the
    education of the Novices and the program of their exercises. It is according to this instruction
    that the Master of Novices guides the Novitiate and organizes the teachings.
</p>


<h2 id="norm79">Norm 79</h2>

<p>
    The Master of Novices is to send to the Major Superior at least twice during the year a report
    on each of the Novices. In the last report preceding the decision on whether or not to allow the
    candidate to profess Vows he also sends his personal vote of confidence or lack therefore of
    together with the opinion of the Monks in the Novitiate who are Solemnly Professed, with the
    exception of designated confessors. He should also include the results of their secret ballots
    as to whether to allow or refuse the Novice Profession of Vows. This has the force of a
    consultative voice for the Major Superior and his Council.
</p>


<h2 id="norm80">Norm 80</h2>

<p>
    Confessors are to be easily accessible in the Novitiate House. Each Novice should take advantage
    of the spiritual direction of a regular confessor, receiving the Sacrament of Penance at least
    once every two weeks.
</p>
<p>
    The Novice Master should not hear the confessions of the Novices.
</p>


<h2 id="norm81">Norm 81</h2>

<p>
    The Prior of the Monastery housing the Novitiate in administrating that House should keep in
    mind those things which are truly good for formation and should be a source of support for the
    Master of Novices in fulfilling his tasks.
</p>
<p>
    By virtue of permanent delegation on the part of the Major Superior, the Prior is the one who
    receives vows in accordance with the precepts of Law and the monastic ceremonial. In matters of
    house discipline both the Master of Novices and the novices themselves are subject to his
    authority.
</p>

<h2 id="norm82">Norm 82</h2>

<p>
    The Major Superior determines the canonical beginning for the period of Novitiate. At the very
    beginning of Novitiate each Novice is to submit a handwritten declaration stating that he freely
    enters the Order and in the event that he leaves it for whatever reason he will not seek
    recompense either for the time spent or work done in the Order.
</p>


<h2 id="norm83">Norm 83</h2>

<p>
    Monies and personal effects belonging to the Novice which are of great worth and which are not
    necessary for daily use should be recorded and kept until such time as they are disposed of
    before the taking of Solemn Vows. With the permission of the Major Superior they may be disposed
    of earlier.
</p>


<h2 id="norm84">Norm 84</h2>

<p>
    Novices are not allowed to use the parlour or to go outside the Monastery without the consent of
    the Master of Novices. Their separation from other members of the Monastery should be regulated
    for pedagogical reasons, namely, so that they might be able to experience both the values and
    the difficulties of a common life. Correspondence of the Novice is subject to prudent
    supervision on the part of the Novice Master.
</p>


<h2 id="norm85">Norm 85</h2>

<p>
    Novices must take examinations in the subject which they have studied. Lack of sufficient
    knowledge in these matters at Novitiate&#8217;s end is sufficient for not admitting the candidate to
    Vows.
</p>


<h2 id="norm86">Norm 86</h2>

<p>
    Brothers in their second year of Novitiate deepening their Religious formation should take an
    ever more active part in the life and the work of the Monastic Novitiate. For the purpose of
    preparing themselves to undertake their responsibilities in the Order, it is possible for them
    to live even outside the Novitiate House with the permission of the Major Superior.
