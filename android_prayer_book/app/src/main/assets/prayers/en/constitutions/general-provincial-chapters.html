<h1 class="index">Chapter I: The General and Provincial Chapters</h1>


<h2 id="norm111">Norm 111</h2>

<p>
    The Father General of the Order convenes the General Chapter by an official letter of
    convocation, which is sent to all members three months prior to the beginning of an ordinary
    Chapter.
</p>
<p>
    The Vicar of the Order has the responsibility to convene an Electoral Chapter no later than
    within one month so that it might begin within the time frame of three months from the day, when
    the office of Father General becomes vacant.
</p>
<p>
    The time extraordinary Chapter is left to the discretion of the Father General together with his
    Definitors.
</p>


<h2 id="norm112">Norm 112</h2>

<p>
    The Father General together with the deciding vote of the Definitors establishes electoral
    districts and councils. They also determine the place and date when the elections will take
    place as well as appointing the Presider of the College.
</p>

<ol class="alph">
    <li>
        Each group of Fathers and Brothers consisting of at least ten members has the right to
        choose one delegate and his substitute.
    </li>
    <li>
        Monasteries having at least ten Priests have the right to create their own council. If
        the number of Fathers in a given house allows for forming two or more such colleges
        consisting of at least ten members (this should be determined according to order and time of
        profession) each of these groups selects from among its number one delegate and one
        substitute. When the final number does not exceed ten Fathers they should be included in
        a group set up by the Father General and the Definitors.
        The Presider of each electoral college is usually the local Prior or a Father appointed
        by the
        Father General.
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The General and the Definitors into regional electoral college will join all the others
            who
            do not number the required number of Fathers, together. The place of their meeting will
            be
            the Monastery, which has the greatest number of Fathers. Those Monks of our Houses that
            are
            nearby should be joined to this Monastery. This same obtains to those Monks working in
            nearby Pastoral centres so that the total number of electors should be at least ten
            Fathers.
            Such a collegial group has the right to select one delegate and one substitute delegate.
            If
            in such a case there were to be a surplus of electors over and above five Fathers such a
            group selects one substitute. In the opposite case namely a group consisting of five or
            less
            Fathers it should be joined to the last electoral group. The local Prior oversees the
            elections.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Prior of Jasna Gora by virtue of law is a member of the General Chapter. As
            regards elections of delegates, however, he has no voice either active or passive.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li> The Father General is prohibited for the period of one year preceding the Chapter from
        transferring any of the Fathers or Brothers from the Monasteries to which they have been
        attached. Should such a need arise they should be joined to that electoral group which is in
        the Monastery of which they were members prior to their transfer.
    </li>
    <li> Once the electors are gathered in the designated Monastery they proceed in a secret ballot
        to choose two examiners and the secretary of the elections according to the precepts of
        Canon Law (Can. 173). Whoever receives an absolute majority of the votes is regarded as the
        elected delegate according to Cannon (Can. 119, &#167;. 1). The same procedure is used for
        choosing the substitute delegate.
    </li>
    <li> The Presider of each electoral group will send to the General Curia a record of the
        concluded elections together with the name of the delegate and his substitute including the
        exact number of votes which each received. This report should be signed by the Presider, the
        secretary and the Scrutineers.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="norm113">Norm 113</h2>

<p>
    Seminarian Brothers in Solemn Vows who enjoy only an active voice in the election of delegates
    to the general electoral Chapter constitute together with the Fathers of the House of Studies
    one collegial electoral group.
</p>
<p>
    The Presider of this collegial group is the Prior of the House of Studies.
</p>
<p>
    The election of delegates takes place in the same manner as in other collegial elections with
    this that one or more delegates and their substitutes are chosen successively in the proportion
    of one delegate for every ten electors.
</p>
<p>
    In the event that the final number of members should exceed five Fathers or Seminarian Brothers
    the group should choose one more delegate and his substitute.
</p>

<h2 id="norm114">Norm 114</h2>

<p>
    Brothers in Solemn Profession, who also have the right of choosing out of a group of ten
    Brothers one delegate and his substitute, follow the same procedure as do the Fathers.
</p>
<p>
    In those monasteries where the number of Brothers exceeds ten, one or more collegial electoral
    groups should be formed. In monasteries having a lesser number of Brothers, the Father General
    with the approval of the Definitors joins them together with designated monasteries where there
    is a larger number of Brothers who form into one collegial voting group which in turn chooses as
    described above one delegate and one substitute from among its members. In the event that the
    last group of Brothers exceeds the number five they have the right to choose one more delegate
    together with his substitute.
</p>
<p>
    The Presider of the collegial group of Brothers is appointed by the Father General with the
    Definitors.
</p>

<h2 id="norm115">Norm 115</h2>


<ol>
    <li>
        <p>Both Fathers and Brothers who are excused for acknowledged reasons from personally taking
            part in the elections, which excuse must be approved and confirmed by the local Prior,
            are able to send their ballot through one of the other Fathers or Brothers or even by mail
            in which case this should be done by including the ballot in a double sealed envelope. The
            inner envelope should contain the names of the delegates written on separate cards.
            This is the envelope, which will be publicly handed over to the Presider after the
            beginning of the elections and at the time of the casting of ballots under the direction
            of the scrutineers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additional details are determined each and every time by the Father
            General together with his Definitors.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        Should no one receive a majority vote after the second ballot the Presider will all the
        electors as to which two candidates received the greatest number of votes and order a third
        round of voting. The electors will then choose one of these two candidates who is to be the
        delegate. The one who in this third balloting receives the greatest number of votes after
        the successful candidate will be regarded as his substitute.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="norm116">Norm 116</h2>

<p>
    Should Provinces be erected in Our Order, they take part in the General Electoral Chapter, with
    the Provincial and two priest delegates elected by the Fathers (of the Province) as well as one
    Brother elected by the Brothers. The election of the provincial delegates for the General
    Chapter is done by Fathers and Brothers in electoral colleges established by the Provincial,
    voting on a general list (Fathers for Fathers, Brothers for Brothers) This list of candidates is
    drawn up and given to each college by the Father Provincial. The chosen delegates and their
    substitutes, who after the votes are counted in the colleges, by the Provincial Curia, are those
    who have the most votes.
</p>

<h2 id="norm117">Norm 117</h2>

<p>
    The delegates to a General or Provincial Chapter are representatives of those who elected them.
    Consequently, they should in a responsible manner gather and formulate written petitions and
    present them at the meetings of the Chapter.
</p>
<p>
    The delegates should strive to have their own personal independently formulated opinions
    regarding both candidates for office as well as various other matters pertaining to the good of
    the Order. They are forbidden to solicit votes either for themselves or for others. Their term
    of office expires at the conclusion of the Chapter.
</p>

<h2 id="norm118">Norm 118</h2>

<p>
    The General Chapter should begin and continue within its designated time frame and place even if
    all the members are not present so long as two-thirds of all the members of the Chapter are in
    attendance. Whatever is approved by the Chapter obliges the whole Order and every member
    individually.
</p>

<h2 id="norm119">Norm 119</h2>

<p>
    Except for councillors and experts which the Chapter might call upon in the course of its
    deliberations and who have no right to vote, all others are excluded from the Chapter. If anyone
    wishes to present to the Chapter some petition or suggestion he should do so through one of the
    members of the Chapter or send it directly to the Father General.
</p>


<h2 id="norm120">Norm 120</h2>

<p>
    Prior to the convening of the Chapter the Father General appoints an administrator for the
    Chapter who, together with the local Prior, is responsible for preparing everything which will
    be required. With the assistance of Brothers designated for this purpose it is the
    administrator&#8217;s responsibility to see that all is in readiness in the Church, in the cells,
    refectory and whatever else might be useful to the members of the Chapter. A master of
    ceremonies for the Chapter should also be appointed who should see to the proper execution of
    all liturgical functions and ceremonies connected with the Chapter.
</p>
<h2 class="index">The Order and Execution of the General Chapter</h2>

<h2 id="norm121">Norm 121</h2>

<p>
    On the day appointed for the beginning of the Chapter at the time designated by the Father
    General the votive Mass of the Holy Spirit is celebrated according to rubrics and is
    concelebrated by the Father General and the Fathers of the Chapter. The other Monks are obliged
    to take part in it also. Included in this Mass should be proper prayers designated for the
    beginning of the Chapter as found in our ceremonial.
</p>
<p>
    After the Mass an appropriate signal is given to all members to take their places in the Chapter
    Hall. Here, the Father General delivers an appropriate address and reminds one and all of the
    obligation to secrecy regarding those matters which are discussed in the Chapter. He uses the
    following formula:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <em>&#8220;We hereby decree that no one dare to reveal to others the secret matters of this Chapter or
        of our Order either directly or indirectly by word or in writing or in any other manner. By
        Chapter or Order secrets we understand anything which could bring about scandal or loss of
        good name or the disruption of peace to the Order, to the Monastery or to any one of our
        members. By outsiders, we understand all those who are not members of the General Chapter.
        The Father General alone is authorised to reveal such matters only for a serious cause and
        at the proper time.&#8221;</em>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="norm122">Norm 122</h2>

<p>
    In matters of precedence during the Chapter, the first place is given to the Father General and
    to those who legitimately lead during the Chapter proceedings. Following them come: the Vicar of
    the Order, ex-Generals, the Definitors-General, the Procurator-General, the
    Administrator-General, Secretary-General, provincials, quasi-Provincials and the remaining
    delegates according to their date of profession this being counted from their first profession
    according to rules of precedence.
</p>

<h2 id="norm123">Norm 123</h2>

<p>
    The Father General who presides over the Chapter calls for a reading of the list of the members
    of the Chapter. Should his office be vacant this is done by the Vicar General or if he is
    legitimately impeded from doing so by the next Definitor-General.
</p>
<p>
    The members of the Chapter then proceed by the secret ballot to choose two scrutineers and a
    secretary of the Chapter who fulfil their office to the end of the Chapter. For keeping more
    efficient records, several recording clerks may be appointed to assist the secretary of the
    Chapter. Next, the Chapter chooses a Presider who will lead in Chapter business up until the
    time of the elections of a new Father-General. All the above mentioned namely, the Presider of
    the Chapter, the secretary and scrutineers will be chosen by a majority vote according to the
    precepts of Canon Law after which they are to take the following oath:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <em>&#8220;I, Brother <strong>N. N.</strong>, do solemnly swear that I will faithfully fulfil my
        obligations as (Presider of the Chapter/ secretary of the Chapter/ scrutineer of the
        Chapter) and will keep intact the seal of secrecy as to matters pertaining to the Chapter.
        So help me God and His Holy Passion.&#8221; Then he kisses the Cross.</em>
</blockquote>


<h2 id="norm124">Norm 124</h2>

<p>
    The next order of business consists of a report given by the Father General or the one who takes
    his place signed by himself and the whole body of Definitors. This report, which should include
    various details given by heads of various departments, should include the following:
</p>

<ol class="alph">
    <li> The state of personnel in the Order;</li>
    <li> The state of morals and Monastic discipline;</li>
    <li> The state of activity on the Pastoral, formational and educational levels, etc.</li>
    <li> The financial state of the Order together with detailed financial statements;</li>
    <li> Suggestions and proposals for the future.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    After the Father General places his hands into the hands of the Presider, and at the same time
    handing over the seal of the Order.
</p>

<p>
    The formula of resignation is as follows:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <em>&#8220;Very Reverend Father, I place into your hands the office of General which was entrusted to
        me by the Order and at the same time express to the entire community my regrets for any
        mistakes or negligence I may have committed.&#8221;</em>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Next, he takes his place at the right hand of the Presider.
</p>

<h2 id="norm125">Norm 125</h2>

<p>
    Before proceeding to a detailed discussion on the report given by the Father-General, the
    Chapter should appoint if it recognizes this as necessary, commissions consisting of at least
    three persons to examine the report in all its specific details concerning the activity of the
    Order.
</p>
<p>
    After this members of the Chapter proceed to a thorough examination of the Father General
    in a manner which is objective, sincere, free-flowing and consistent with fraternal charity. If
    asked to do so the Father General should give any explanation or reasons for the course of his
    actions. The Presider should take care that the flow and proper character of the discussion is
    unimpeded rejecting decidedly and irresponsible statements that might be made.
</p>

<h2 id="norm126">Norm 126</h2>

<p>
    When the Presider feels that the topic under discussion has been sufficiently examined and after
    voting to receive the report as called for by the Constitutions, the next order of business is
    the election of the Father General.
</p>
<p>
    There should be present in the place of meeting, an urn to be used for the casting of ballots,
    and everything else that is necessary for the process of voting. All present recite the hymn to
    the Holy Spirit, found in our ceremonial.
</p>
<p>
    The secretary of the Chapter than announces the list
    of those who are eligible to vote and the Presider adds these words:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <em>&#8220;We hereby instruct and command that all the members of the Chapter who are about to vote
        should keep the Lord God before their eyes; casting aside any human respect let everyone
        choose the one whom in the Spirit of God he recognizes to be worthy and capable to bear the
        burden of the highest office in the Order.&#8221;</em>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Following this all the electors each in his turn makes the following oath:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <em>&#8220;I, Brother N.N., do solemnly swear that in proceeding to vote for the Father General and
        the general administration of our Order, I will vote for those persons whom in conscience I
        feel to be most responsible and worthy. So help me God and His Holy Passion.&#8221;</em>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="norm127">Norm 127</h2>

<p>
    The scrutineers should see to it that electors cast their secret ballots each one individually.
    They then approach each of the electors who in turn cast their ballot into the urn on which
    there is written the name and surname of the candidate. They should be folded in the same manner
    as all the others. When all ballots have been cast, the scrutineers shake the urn and then
    empties it in front of the Presider. Leaving each ballot folded he determines with the second
    scrutineer whether the number of ballots is the same as the number of those voting. If there are
    more cards than there are electors the vote is invalid and must be repeated. If the number
    agrees, the first scrutineer opens them one by one and hands it over to the Presider and second
    scrutineer while announcing the name and the surname.
</p>
<p>
    Should any member of the Chapter be
    present in the house where the elections are taking place but himself be unable to take part in
    the voting because of sickness his written vote should be received by the scrutineers at the
    time of the election in the usual manner as described above. After each voting session or
    meeting the ballots should be burned immediately.
</p>

<h2 id="norm128">Norm 128</h2>

<p>
    The Father General is elected by the absolute majority of votes cast. After the legitimately
    conducted election the candidate who receives more than half of the votes of those present
    should be declared the Father General. This is in accordance with Canon Law (Can. 119, &#167;. 1). If
    no one receives an absolute majority in the voting process then according to the tradition of
    our Order a second and third ballot ensues. In the event that even on the third ballot no one
    receives an absolute majority, then the Presider announces the two candidates who received the
    most votes using the following formula:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <em>&#8220;Two Fathers have received the majority of the votes namely, Father N.N. and Father N.N., of
        these two we now proceed to select one to be the General of the Order.&#8221;</em>
</blockquote>
<p>
    It should be noted that if two or more candidates receive the same amount of votes then
    precedence is given to the candidate who is older by profession and if they are both of the same
    year in profession then the one who is older in age.
    A forth ballot takes place in which the two Fathers in question have only a passive voice
    without active participation, these two who received the majority of the votes.
    The electors proceed to cast a secret ballot for one of them. The one who receives the majority
    of votes on this ballot is then announced as the winner. Should they both receive the same
    amount of votes than the one who is older by Profession (dating from first Profession) should be
    selected as the Father General. Should they both be of the same year of Profession then the one
    who is older by age is chosen. At the conclusion of balloting, the Presider of the Chapter turns
    to the newly elected and asks him:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <em>&#8220;Very Reverend Father do you accept the valid election as carried out by our General Chapter
        to assume the Office of General of the whole Order?&#8221;</em>
</blockquote>
<p>
    When the one elected expresses his consent the Presider should immediately announce the
    following:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <em>&#8220;I, Brother <strong>N. N.</strong>, after invoking the help of the Holy Spirit and having
        overseen the election conducted at this plenary session of the General Chapter, declare that
        the majority of electors have reached consent and have chosen Father <strong>N. N.</strong>
        Therefore, in my own name, and in the name of all of you here gathered, and by the authority
        which you have granted me, I declare this same Father <strong>N. N.</strong> to be the
        General of the Order of St. Paul the First Hermit.&#8221;</em>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="norm129">Norm 129</h2>

<p>
    The newly elected Father General comes forward and kneeling before the Cross takes the following
    oath:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <em>&#8220;I, Brother <strong>N. N.</strong>, solemnly swear that according to God and my own
        conscience in accordance with the Constitutions and Directory of our Order, I will exercise
        authority over our Community putting aside all human respect, I further swear that I will do
        what is in my power to assist in the development of the Order, the keeping of the vows, and
        for creating unity and charity among our brethren and will make every effort to develop our
        specific Marian apostolate.
    </em></p>
    <p>
        <em>&#8220;Finally, I swear that I will guard the spiritual heritage of the
        Order and will execute care over its material goods giving an exact accounting of the same
        at the proper time. So help me God and His Holy Passion.&#8221;</em>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Next, he makes the Profession of Faith.
</p>
<p>
    If the Father General-elect should not be present, he should be immediately summoned and asked
    his intentions according to the aforementioned formula.
</p>

<h2 id="norm130">Norm 130</h2>

<p>
    Following this the Presider or the secretary of the Chapter should the Presider be the one
    elected Father General, in the presence of the entire community where the Chapter takes place,
    hands him the book of the Constitutions together with the Directory and the seal. Next, he makes
    an act of obedience by giving him the kiss of peace. He also should notify all of our monastic
    houses and the proper Church institutions regarding the election of the new General of the
    Order. With this, his function as Presider of the Chapter ceases. All present in the room should
    express the respect and readiness to give obedience to the Father-General in the manner
    described above. Finally, all should go in procession to the Church for prayers of thanksgiving
    according to our Ceremonial.
</p>

<h2 id="norm131">Norm 131</h2>

<p>
    All records of the election should be carefully prepared by the secretary of the Chapter and
    signed by the Presider, scrutineers and same secretary and should be included with the records
    of the Chapter itself and preserved in the archives of the Order.
</p>

<h2 id="norm132">Norm 132</h2>

<p>
    The election of the five Definitors of whom the first is the Vicar of the Order as well as the
    Procurator-General and Administrator-General takes place under the leadership of the new Father
    General by all the members of the Chapter in the manner described below.
</p>
<p>
    Those who have not been professed at least ten years in our Order counting the time from Solemn
    Profession are ineligible for the following office: Vicar of the Order, Definitors-General,
    Procurator-General and Administrator-General. Their manner of being elected, announced and
    oath-taking is the same as obliges upon the election of the Father General, those differences
    being maintained which pertain only to the highest Major Superior. The formula for the oath of
    the newly elected is as follows:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <em>&#8220;I, Brother <strong>N. N.</strong>, solemnly swear that I will cooperate conscientiously
        with the Father General for the good of the Order and in a spirit of charity will serve my
        brethren according to the dictates of conscience and the Law of the Order, so help me God
        and His Holy Passion.&#8221;</em>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="norm133">Norm 133</h2>

<p>
    The General Officers chosen as described above fulfil their obligations until the next General
    Chapter of Elections. They cannot be removed from office other than for serious and just reasons
    by the Father General with the deciding vote of the General Definitorium.
</p>
<p>
    If the Vicar of the
    Order or one of the Definitors or Administrator resigns from office or should this office become
    vacant for whatever reason, it is incumbent to choose a new Vicar, Definitor or Administrator
    with the deciding voice of the Definitorium.
</p>
<p>
    Whenever the office of Procurator-General becomes vacant, however, the Father General appoints
    another Monk to take his place with the deciding vote of his Definitorium and notifies the Holy
    See as to the change.
</p>
<p>
    The selection of a Secretary-General is dependent upon the Father General with the consent of
    his Definitors. The one so chosen takes the following oath before the Cross.
</p>
<blockquote>
    <em>&#8220;I, Brother <strong>N. N.</strong>, solemnly swear that I will keep the seal of secrecy
        according to the conscience as regards all matters I will hear discussed in the Definitorium
        or during visitations. So help me God and His Holy Passion.&#8221;</em>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="norm134">Norm 134</h2>

<p>
    The Chapter then proceeds to a discussion of the following:
</p>

<ol class="alph">
    <li> Problems, suggestions and propositions which are contained in the aforementioned report of
        the general administration which have as their aim the raising of the level of Monastic Life
        ( Can. 631) all in the light of our Pauline heritage and our mission ( Can. 578, <a href="general-chapter.html#art107" ebook="ebook">Art. 107</a>

    <li> Requests which were submitted by delegates or other members of the Order;</li>
    <li> The recommendations of the Last General Chapter.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    For developing the quality of the general good of the Order, all of our Monks are able to
    present their wishes and desires in a written form to the Chapter through anyone of its members
    or through the Father General himself.
</p>
<p>
    The Chapter, however, will decide whether a given matter should be debated and put to a vote.
    Members of the Chapter are free to state publicly their observations and wishes with the request
    that they put to a vote. It is not advisable to take immediate action on the matters leading to
    a serious decision if this has been preceded by stormy discussions.
</p>
<p>
    While the Chapter is in session there will also take place sessions of the General Definitorium
    during which delegates will be given a hearing if they wish to place before it different needs
    or problems of their regions, monasteries or various persons. Their request will be decided upon
    by the General Definitorium or the Chapter itself.
</p>

<h2 id="norm135">Norm 135</h2>

<p>
    It is the responsibility of the Father General together with the Definitorium to see to it that
    all matters which demand a solution be given full attention and discussion during the sessions
    of the Chapter. They are to see to it also that the matters under discussion be treated in
    depth. Each problem should be thoroughly analysed in a peaceful manner and brought to a
    conclusion without undue haste.
</p>

<h2 id="norm136">Norm 136</h2>

<p>
    The secretary of the Chapter records all decisions and commands made at the Chapter and reads
    them publicly at the last meeting. When they are accepted and signed by members of the Chapter
    and duly sealed with the seal of the Order they, by that very fact, take the force of law. They
    begin to oblige when they are made public in a manner determined by the Father General.
</p>

<h2 id="norm137">Norm 137</h2>

<p>
    During the time of the Chapter Mass should be celebrated for the souls of our Monks, confraters,
    benefactors and friends of the Order who have died from the time of the last Chapter.
</p>
<p>
    At the conclusion of the Chapter the Father General celebrates a Mass of Thanksgiving in which
    all the members of the Chapter and insofar as possible the member of the local monastery take
    part. Included in this Mass is the hymn of Thanksgiving (Te Deum) and intercessory prayers for
    the intention of the Order.
</p>

<h2 class="index">Provincial Chapter</h2>

<h2 id="norm138">Norm 138</h2>

<p>
    The Provincial Chapter takes place every three years in a place and at time designated by the
    Father provincial with prior approval of the Father General. The Father General together with
    his Council convokes the Chapter. It should be noted that the time for this provincial Chapter
    should not conflict with the time of a General Chapter but rather should precede it.
</p>


<h2 id="norm139">Norm 139</h2>

<p>
    The members of the provincial Chapter include: the Father General or his delegate; the Fathers
    provincial or quasi-provincial together with four Definitors. Besides these, delegates from the
    whole province chosen according to our Order&#8217;s law who equal in number those who take part in
    the provincial Chapter by virtue of the law.
</p>


<h2 id="norm140">Norm 140</h2>

<p>
    The General Chapter determines the manner for choosing and the number of delegates from the
    communities to the Provincial Chapter. Until this is done, the Father General assumes this
    responsibility together with his council in accordance with Article 138 of our Constitutions.
</p>


<h2 id="norm141">Norm 141</h2>

<p>
    The Order and execution of the Provincial Chapter, namely, its deliberations, discussions,
    voting and conclusion is subject to the same laws which bind the General Chapter with the
    exception of all those details which are proper to the General Chapter.
</p>

<h2 id="norm142">Norm 142</h2>

<p>
    The Provincial Chapter should elect the Father provincial and his Council which consists of four
    Definitors the first of whom becomes the Vicar of the province as well as the Administrator and
    Secretary of the Province together and according to those same precepts which bind during the
    General Chapter in the election of these same officers.
</p>
<p>
    The Presider of the Provincial Chapter will be the Father General or his delegate up until its
    conclusion.
</p>
<p>
    All the decisions of the Provincial Chapter oblige when they have been approved by the Father
    General and his Council and are announced by the Father Provincial.
</p>

<h2 id="norm143">Norm 143</h2>

<p>
    The Provincial enjoys all the rights and bears all responsibilities proper to a Major Superior
    in the territory of his Province in accordance with the precepts of Canon Law, the Constitutions
    and the General Directory. In no way encroaching upon the authority of the Father General, which
    is spelled out in the Constitutions and the General Directory, the provincial cooperates with
    the same Father General for the good for the entire Order and for the spirit of unity and
    submission.
