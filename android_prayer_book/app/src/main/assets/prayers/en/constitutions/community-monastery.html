<h1 class="index">Chapter V: The Community of the Monastery</h1>


<h2 id="art142">Article 142</h2>


<ol>
    <li> Those who are called to live a religious life according to Evangelical Counsels live out
        their calling within the context of the Order. The Order fulfils its function of giving
        glory to God and serving the Church first and foremost through its Religious Communities.
    </li>

    <li> A Religious House is created by the Father General with the concurring voice of his Council
        (Art 130, &#167;1) having received the written permission of the local Ordinary (Can. 609, &#167;. 1).
        Included in this written permission is the right for the House to have its own Church (Can.
        611, 1215, &#167;. 3).
    </li>

    <li> Each of our Houses should have its own Chapel in which the Blessed Sacrament is preserved
        and the Eucharistic Sacrifice offered. The Chapel becomes the true Centre of Community.
    </li>

    <li> A legitimately erected Religious House can be suppressed by the Father General with the
        agreement of his Council after he has notified the Bishop of the Diocese. In this case
        property of the House is transferred to the Order (Can. 616, &#167;. 1).
    </li>


</ol>

<h2 id="art143">Article 143</h2>

<p>
    A complete Monastic Community should be composed of at least six Monks including the Superior
    and his officers. The Monastic Community should gather for common prayer and should seek to
    deepen the bond of mutual charity whose goal is to be one in the Lord.
</p>
<p>
    The Order consists also of other smaller communities which although they do not constitute a
    fully formed monastery they nonetheless have their own Superior named by competent authority.
    These communities should strive according to their means to lead a Monastic Life.
</p>

<h2 id="art144">Article 144</h2>

<p>
    The Religious Community supports itself by the revenues forthcoming from the work of its members
    as well as from income accruing from properties belonging to the Order as well as from the
    offerings of the faithful.
</p>
<p>
    All the income of the Community and each of its members is entrusted to the Superior who in turn
    after consulting with his Council proceeds to allocate it for various purposes either himself or
    through the administrator. Both Superior and administrator should give an accounting of their
    allocation of funds to the same Council at least every two months.
</p>


<h2 class="index">The Prior of the Monastery</h2>


<h2 id="art145">Article 145</h2>

<p>
    In order to assure the proper functioning of a given Monastic Community the Major Superior, with
    the agreement of the Definitors, names a Prior for this same community, whose term of office
    extends for three years. He should be a Monk with at least five years of Solemn Profession (Can.
    623). Before naming the Prior, the Major Superior should seek the opinion of the members of the
    Monastic Community in whatever form he feels appropriate (Can. 625, &#167;. 3).
</p>
<p>
    The Prior can be reappointed for a second three-year term never, however, for a third term
    without at least a one-year interval (Can. 624, p.2). The Prior&#8217;s authority extends to the
    domain of both external and internal forums (Can. 596, &#167;. 2).
</p>
<p>
    The one who is chosen Prior should accept his office fully aware of his duty to serve all his
    confreres in the Community. His model in doing this will be Christ Himself serving His apostles
    and seeking the Will of His Father in all things.
</p>


<h2 id="art146">Article 146</h2>

<p>
    The office of Prior demands a well-rounded knowledge of the spiritual and material state of the
    Monastery, together with the responsibilities which the Community has to the people of God.
    The Prior should take advantage of the observations made in writing by his predecessor from whom
    he receives his office in the presence of the Major Superior or his delegate.
</p>


<h2 id="art147">Article 147</h2>

<p>
    It is the Prior&#8217;s responsibility to help each of his brethren more easily to fulfil the Will of
    God. He himself comes to know this Will through sincere dialogue with his Brothers.
</p>
<p>
    He will be able to gain the trust of his brethren, which is so indispensable for the proper
    carrying out of his office, if in those more serious decisions which he is called upon to make,
    he consults with his Brothers. Be this in the framework of the Council of the house or at
    Chapters of the Monastery, or through consulting specialists. In this way, the Monks will
    realise that he is striving to fulfil his office in a responsible manner as he leads them to the
    Lord.
</p>

<h2 id="art148">Article 148</h2>

<p>
    As he, himself zealously makes efforts to be united to Christ, the Prior takes special care to
    look after the spiritual development of his brethren. He does this by making every effort to see
    that the Eucharist becomes the sign and the source of charity and unity in Christ for all the
    members of the Community. On major feast days, he should personally preside at the offering of
    the Eucharistic Sacrifice. Moreover, he should deliver a conference to his confreres at least
    once a month (Can. 619).
</p>
<p>
    By suitably organizing the work of the Community and through a prudent distribution of
    responsibility, he should strive to create such a climate within the religious house to
    contribute to a well-rounded personal development of the members, all in the spirit of the
    Gospel.
</p>

<h2 id="art149">Article 149</h2>

<p>
    The role of Prior demands that he himself look to the proper management of his own personal life
    and work as well as his undertaking various initiatives. He should also seek to mobilise all the
    members of the Community so that a dynamic cooperative effort results. In this way, the members
    of the Community will begin to deepen their own sense of responsibility for the Kingdom of God
    as regards the Community and the Church as a whole.
</p>


<h2 id="art150">Article 150</h2>

<p>
    The prior should always be able to count on the good will of his brethren especially those who
    hold office with him in the Community. Let him take care to bring to completion those plans and
    decisions which have been undertaken. He should acknowledge the hard work and zeal of those
    members of the Community who distinguish themselves. This should be done in the presence of the
    Community. He should encourage those who lag behind and if need be should penalize them. He
    should meet the needs of his Brothers in an appropriate fashion. He should look after those who
    are sick, console the faint of heart and strive to be patient toward all (1 Thes 5, 14).
</p>

<h2 id="art151">Article 151</h2>

<p>
    The Prior of the house should easily available to all his brethren. In the event that he must
    leave the Monastery for serious reasons, he should provide for the normal functioning of its
    daily life (Can. 629).
</p>
<p>
    He should strive to be an example in Community prayers and works and should strive to take part
    in common.
</p>

<h2 id="art152">Article 152</h2>

<p>
    It is the responsibility of the Prior to lead the Community into an ever-clearer understanding
    and living out of the rules of the Constitutions. Let him use his authority to grant
    dispensations in particular instances, with prudence and only for just reasons.
</p>


<h2 id="art153">Article 153</h2>

<p>
    When he is forced at times to make a most definitive decision, the Prior must take care that he
    should rule his Brothers, &#8220;in such a way that they would love him more than fear him&#8221; (The Rule
    of St. Augustine).
</p>
<p>
    In showing respect to the Prior in the name of the Lord, members of the Community should pray
    for him, and they should seek to so live their lives that the office which he holds would be for
    him a joy rather than a burden (Hebrews 13, 17).
</p>


<h2 id="art154">Article 154</h2>

<p>
    With the deciding voice of his Council, a Major Superior even outside the time of visitation may
    remove a Prior from office. This would take place in the event of gross negligence of his
    responsibility as defined in the Constitutions or for the other serious reasons which would make
    his service ineffective (Cam. 624, &#167;. 3).
</p>


<h2 class="index">The Subprior</h2>


<h2 id="art155">Article 155</h2>

<p>
    The Major Superior with the consent of his Council nominates a Subprior even several
    representatives of the Prior as the needs and obligations of the Monastery may demand. He should
    do this after soliciting the opinion of the Prior and members of the Community. The Prior
    determines their duties and obligations.
</p>
<p>
    His term of office ordinarily last for three years but may be renewed in case of necessity.
</p>
<p>
    In the absence of the Prior, he assumes the duties of Superior of the House with the exception
    of those things, which the Prior has reserved to himself.
</p>


<h2 id="art156">Article 156</h2>

<p>
    The Subprior is the closest co-worker with the Prior. It belongs to his office to strengthen the
    unity and charity among the members of the Community as well as to mediate in the event
    quarrelsome situations arise between the Members and the Prior.
</p>
<p>
    To the extent necessary, he should bring to the Prior&#8217;s attention those matters, which concern
    his personal good and the good of the Community.
</p>
<p>
    It is his responsibility either in person or through competent persons to be concerned with the
    worthy carrying out of the Sacred Liturgy as well as the beauty of the Church in the Monastery.
    He also is responsible for keeping the Monastery chronicles. He has to care for those who are
    sick and extends sincere hospitality to guests.
</p>

<h2 id="art157">Article 157</h2>

<p>
    Members of the house council, next to the Prior, who presides over it, are the Subprior or
    Subpriors, the custodian, the administrator and community delegates, the number of which is
    determined according to the size of the house. The choice of delegates is made by the community,
    and are confirmed by their Major Superior. If the Prior is changed or the tenure is renewed, the
    house councillors must be confirmed again. The secretary of the council is nominated by the
    prior and takes the minutes of the meetings in their proper book.

    majority of those serving on the House Council can also convene it. Its area of competence
    includes:
