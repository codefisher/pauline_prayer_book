<h1 class="index">Chapter II: Religious Profession</h1>


<h2 id="norm1">Norm 1</h2>

<p>
    Our Monks should dedicate one month&#8217;s time in solitude and prayer under the direction of a
    Priest chosen by a Major Superior in making a proper preparation before Solemn Profession.
</p>

<h2 id="norm2">Norm 2</h2>

<p>
    In the document which is proof of profession and in the copy of the same there should be noted
    that the date and place of birth of the one making Profession together with the names of his
    parents and the day, month and year of the Profession itself. This document should be signed by
    the one making Profession, and the one before whom he made profession as well as by the Master
    of Novices or the Superior of the House of those who are professed. The document should be
    preserved in the archives of the Order. A copy of the same should be preserved in the archives
    of the House where profession was made.
</p>
<p>
    Moreover, after making Solemn profession in accordance with the Norms of Law the Secretary
    General or Provincial should give notification of the profession to the Parish Priest of the
    Parish in which the professed member was baptised.
</p>
<h2 class="index">Evangelical Chastity</h2>

<h2 id="norm3">Norm 3</h2>

<p>
    Since we value chastity, which is undertaken for the sake of the kingdom of God, we must take
    care that:
    We develop a spirit of prayer and sacrifice; that we take as our example the Mother of Christ
    developing with her a bond of filial and total trust; making every effort to avoid idleness and
    a life of ease. We should be eager to undertake work which puts to good use our talents and our
    energy.
    Furthermore, we should cultivate personal, professional interests and other interest, which are
    in harmony with our Vocation. We should make use of modern means of communication with
    moderation and prudence. Care should be taken as regards physical hygiene and psychological
    health. We should do whatever lies within our power to elevate the cultural tone of behaviour in
    the world in which we live.
</p>

<h2 id="norm4">Norm 4</h2>

<p>
    Our Monks in imitation of the openness of Our Lord toward people should have the same attitude
    of respect, tact and dignity in dealing with people avoiding, however, any form of familiarity.
    As they visit their families and have contact with the laity let them be guided in their
    relationships by Pastoral Consideration.
</p>
<p>
    In order to prevent all manner of objectionable visits and the forming of unnecessary
    relationships we should strive to build up and to develop amongst ourselves a very healthy type
    of friendship characterised by mutual understanding, interest and healthy dialogue among
    ourselves.
</p>
<p>
    This fraternal love in Christ demands from all of us but especially from Superiors having a
    sense of responsibility one for the other so that if need be, one may approach his brother
    sincerely and openly to give him admonition and to help him to find his way out of danger.
</p>
<h2 class="index">Evangelical Poverty</h2>

<h2 id="norm5">Norm 5</h2>

<p>
    In acquiring and using material things of value, we are dependent on our Superiors who in turn
    carry out their activity on behalf of the Monastic Community. All manner of offerings, profits,
    rewards, income, salary, annuities, etc. must be placed into the common treasury. From this
    treasury all expenses connected with the taking care of the needs of the whole Community and its
    individual members will be covered.
</p>
<p>
    The Superior or a Monk authorised by him in controlling the monies or other goods of the
    Monastery is bound to abide by the law of justice, Charity and poverty as set forth in the
    Order&#8217;s Law and in the rule of St. Augustine: <em>No one must regard anything as his own, for all
    things should be held in common.
    The Superior should give to each of you food and clothing but not to all in the same degree
    since you do not all have the same type of health, but rather according to the needs of each
    person. For so we read in the Acts of the Apostles that &#8220;they held everything in common and each
    received according to his need&#8221;</em> (Acts 4, 32-35).
</p>
<p>
    On the other hand, each Pauline Monk who has received monies should make an account of them to
    his Superior.
</p>
<p>
    We are free to do as we wish only those things which have little value, when rendering fraternal
    service or showing kindness to other.
</p>

<h2 id="norm6">Norm 6</h2>

<p>
    Each professed member in solemn vows should be given his private room insofar as this is
    possible. The room should be furnished according to the needs of daily use. Furnishing should be
    simple but ascetic avoiding all manner of luxury.
</p>

<h2 id="norm7">Norm 7</h2>

<p>
    The governing body of the Monastery may purchase a car after obtaining permission from the Major
    Superior. The car is for the benefit of the entire Community and is the sole possession of the
    individual Monastery, Province or Order.
</p>
<p>
    The purchase, ownership or use of a private automobile for whatever reason is prohibited.
</p>

<h2 id="norm8">Norm 8</h2>

<p>
    In the event of being transferred to another Monastery, each Monk may take with himself only
    those things, which are for personal use. The contents of the place where he lives or works or
    those things given to him because of a special function, which he fulfils, must be left in the
    House from which he leaves.
</p>
<p>
    The person effects of a deceased Monk remain as the property of the House to which he belonged
    unless the Major Superior decides otherwise. The Superior puts photographs, souvenirs, diaries,
    notes, correspondence, valuable keepsakes, materials or works used for teaching or Pastoral
    ministry into the archives of the House.
</p>
<p>
    The personal effects of a deceased Father General are passed onto his successor.
</p>

<h2 id="norm9">Norm 9</h2>

<p>
    Offerings accrue to the Monastery, as gifts given by the faithful are for the most part what the
    gospel calls &#8220;the widow&#8217;s mite&#8221;, which are given out of Religious motivation. They should be
    utilised in a most responsible manner. Such offerings should be regarded as truly being gifts
    from God. Consequently, we ought to treat with the greatest respect all those things which serve
    the common good and which are given for our personal use. Wastefulness, thoughtlessness,
    destruction and negligence ought to be avoided in all its forms. We ought to develop a sense of
    responsible appreciation for the work efforts and accomplishments of our Brothers.
</p>

<h2 id="norm10">Norm 10</h2>

<p>
    The Vow of poverty binds us in a special way to make the best use of time that we can. We do
    this by a constant conscientious well-organised and fruitful way of working. Interests shown on
    the part of Superiors as well as a favourable atmosphere created by the entire Community go a
    long way in bringing about happy results through our works as well as fostering development of
    each individual.
</p>
<p>
    We are allowed to assume work outside of the Monastery only after having obtained permission
    from competent authorities previously. Over and beyond this any type of activity of a most
    unusual character, which is, not really consonant with our Vocation can be undertaken only for
    the most serious reasons, which are acknowledged by a Major Superior.
</p>

<h2 id="norm11">Norm 11</h2>

<p>
    Our Religious habit consists of the following: a tunic, a belt on which is suspended a set of
    mysteries of the rosary, (5 Decades) a scapular and capuce. All Monks are also allowed to use a
    white skullcap. (Zucchetto) This should be done with uniformity in a given house. Those who are
    have been professed solemnly may also use a mantle with a capuce during Solemn Liturgies.
</p>
<h2 class="index">Religious Obedience</h2>

<h2 id="norm12">Norm 12</h2>

<p>
    Religious obedience binds us not only to submit to competent Superiors but also to take equal
    responsibility with those Superiors for the good of the life of the Community and its various
    undertakings. As a result, it is expected that all members of the Community will take a
    conscious and willing part in working out its problems and daily tasks.
</p>


<h2 id="norm13">Norm 13</h2>

<p>
    In and of the fact that the Superior first and foremost is responsible for the Community as a
    whole and is obliged to very often make serious and difficult decisions let all our Brothers
    pray for him and cooperate with him, showing understanding, good will and respect.
</p>
<p>
    The Superior by virtue of the office he holds after first coming to know the individuals, the
    various conditions and situations that obtain, gives commands and assigns various duties and
    ministries. Should a Brother feel that a given obligation accedes his strength he should make
    this known to the Superior who would then take into account his situation and difficulties. The
    competent Superior should make dispensations or permissions as regards serious matters in
    writing.
</p>
<p>
    Decrees issued by a Major Superior should be regarded as a solemn form of giving orders, which
    in a special manner, bind us to obedience in the spirit of faith.
</p>

<h2 id="norm14">Norm 14</h2>

<p>
    It is important to remember that a negligent carrying out of given commands, complaining and an
    unhealthy criticism not only oppose religious obedience but also take their toll in causing a
    destructive influence on others and in so doing paralyze the life of any Community.
</p>

<h2 id="norm15">Norm 15</h2>

<p>
    Superiors should take care to only rarely and then prudently to give commands binding by virtue
    of the vow of obedience. This should be done only for a grave reason whenever the common good
    demands it, or the good of any individual monk. Moreover, such a command should be given in
    written form and in the presence of two witnesses. Superiors of given Houses should not normally
    give this manner of command and then only by way of exception in urgent matters in which case
    the Major Superior should be notified of this action as soon as possible.
