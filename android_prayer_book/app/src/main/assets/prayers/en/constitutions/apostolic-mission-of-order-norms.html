<h1 class="index">Chapter V: The Apostolic Mission of the Order</h1>


<h2 id="norm51">Norm 51</h2>

<p>
    The entire Pauline family is responsible for carrying out the Apostolic Mission of our Order.
    Mary, the Mother of Christ, and Mother of our Order should be given a special place and
    expression in our Apostolic Activity.
</p>


<h2 id="norm52">Norm 52</h2>

<p>
    From the very beginning of one&#8217;s association with our Order let every member take care to
    understand his role in the Pauline apostolate using those means to develop gifts of nature and
    grace which are open to him. Superiors should be concerned about specialisation on the part of
    their brethren and so far as this is possible assign them to that type of activity in which they
    will be most effective.
</p>

<h2 id="norm53">Norm 53</h2>

<p>
    The Pastoral council, which serves as an advisory body to the general council, initiates and
    coordinates the Pastoral activity of the Order. Its members consist of officials representing
    various phases of our activity such as General Pastoral activity, Marian apostolates, parish
    work, preaching, Vocational work, works of charity etc.
</p>
<p>
    Included in the composition of this council should also be representative of the Priors and
    custodians of our Shrines.
</p>


<h2 id="norm54">Norm 54</h2>

<p>
    It is within the competence of this council to discuss a national program for pastoral activity
    fitting in within the framework of that which is proper to the character and Apostolic Mission
    of our Order. It assists the individual Communities in implementing this activity. In its
    concern for raising the level of Pastoral ministry it also keeps the fathers informed and makes
    accessible to them participation in various meetings, courses, workshops making available to
    them anything that could assist them in their field of specialty.
</p>


<h2 id="norm55">Norm 55</h2>

<p>
    Individual Communities themselves should arrange for Pastoral meetings especially in preparing
    for feast days or before undertaking certain Pastoral actions in order that they might use the
    most effective methods possible in implementing the same.
</p>


<h2 id="norm56">Norm 56</h2>

<p>
    For the purpose of showing proper appreciation for the ministry of preaching especially in the
    shrine at Jasna Gora, the Pastoral Council should create a body of preachers confirmed by the
    Major Superior and entrust to them the special responsibility of preaching the Word of God.
</p>
<p>
    The Pastoral Council, furthermore, should suggest those Fathers who might be considered for
    preaching retreats. It should establish guidelines for them and sponsor business meetings at
    proper times as well as furnishing them with useful materials for their work.
</p>

<h2 id="norm57">Norm 57</h2>


<ol class="alph">
    <li> In all Pastoral Activities carried out by our Order special stress must be given to the
        catechization of children and young people. Considered as a form of preaching the Gospel
        catechization is first and foremost the responsibility of the Parish Priest.
    </li>
    <li> Those who are called to the Office of Catechist cooperate in the work of evangelizing the
        parish in handing on revealed truth. They must dedicate themselves willingly and gladly by
        investing time, energy and talent in order to give children and young people a well-rounded
        experience as regards the teaching of Jesus Christ.
    </li>
    <li> The Parish Priest or Rector being responsible for the area of Pastoral Activity must see to
        it that all available catechetical aids are made available to those who catechise within
        their parish. This would include providing books, catechisms, illustrations, slides, etc.
        which then become the property of that given parish or catechetical centre.
    </li>
    <li> As regards the teaching load and the syllabus of studies catechists are to observe
        conscientiously the Norms accepted by the Episcopal conference or those designated by the
        local Bishop.
    </li>

</ol>

<h2 id="norm58">Norm 58</h2>

<p>
    Out of Pastoral sensitivity to the signs of the times we must give high priority for developing
    the apostolate of the laity. As a result we should take care to:
</p>

<ol class="alph">

    <li> Cultivate among the faithful a sense of responsibility for their role in developing the
        kingdom of God according to the thinking of the II Vatican Council;
    </li>
    <li> Engage the faithful in the Apostolic work of our Order forming groups of helpers both
        clergy and laity to better take advantage of their inspirations and cooperation;
    </li>
    <li> Initiate pastoral Activity which is geared towards various states of life, be it groups of
        professionals, altar servers and so forth, organising days of recollection and conferences
        for them, taking care also to serve those workers who serve in our various monasteries.
    </li>
    <li> Reactivate various forms of Pastoral Ministry from days past through such brotherhoods as
        the Five Wounds of Our Lord Jesus, the Rosary Apostolate, the Confraternity of the Guardian
        Angels, Marian Sodality, etc. Striving also to form various groups of helpers of our Order.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="norm59">Norm 59</h2>

<p>
    We should eagerly pursue the initiatives already undertaken by the Church in the fields of bible
    study, liturgy, pastoral ministry, all of which should serve to make our service of the faithful
    even more effective leading them, thereby, to become more actively involved. In arranging
    various services we should see to it that we use the most effective methods taking advantage of
    developments in the audio-visual field, making use also of the newest forms of communications,
    announcements and advertising all of which would serve to create interest and deepen the faith
    on the part of the faithful.
</p>

<h2 id="norm60">Norm 60</h2>


<ol class="alph">
    <li> The general government of the Order should support and supervise the publishing activities
        of the Order, be that of provinces or individual monasteries. To this end, it should seek to
        form a group of individuals, preferably our own Monks, who would be able to undertake the
        work of editing. Insofar as possible we should also undertake to organise our own printing
        house and other forms of media.
    </li>
    <li> In an era of development and ever greater importance of the Mass Media in the work of
        evangelisation, it is encouraged to take an active part in the Media, respecting the
        necessary prudence and responsibility in the use of the spoken and written word.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="norm61">Norm 61</h2>

<p>
    The consent of the Major Superior is required for establishing a permanent publication in the
    Order, Province or Monastery. It is also his responsibility to approve the regulations or by
    laws to name a director or chief editor for the publication as well as deciding the means for
    financing the same together with determining other conditions which are essential for this type
    of activity. Those engaged as publishers or editors must give this same Major Superior an annual
    report.
</p>


<h2 id="norm62">Norm 62</h2>

<p>
    All members of Our Order are required to secure the permission of the Major Superior before they
    publish either their own personal works or articles in magazines or make any appearance on
    either television or radio. Moreover, they must secure the approval of a censor designated by
    the Major superior and abide by all the decrees of Canon Law.
