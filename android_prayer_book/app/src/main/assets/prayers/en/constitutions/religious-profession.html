<h2 id="art7">Article 7</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Through his profession of the <span index="Evangelical Counsels">Evangelical Counsels</span>
        of <span index="Evangelical Chastity">chastity</span>, <span index="Evangelical Poverty">poverty</span> and <span index="Religious Obedience">obedience</span>, the
        Pauline surrenders himself totally to the <span index="Service of God">service of God</span>, thereby freeing himself from the
        principal obstacles which impede perfect charity. This becomes a special type of
        Consecration which has as its foundation that consecration flowing from <span index="Baptism">Baptism</span>, which it
        expresses more fully.
        Being transformed into &#8220;the new man&#8221; in a more perfect way, the Monk partakes in the dignity
        and freedom of the sons of God and follows the law of charity. Faithfulness to the <span index="Monastic Vocation">Monastic
            Vocation</span> brings about furthermore, the Pauline&#8217;s more effective service to the <span index="Church">Church</span> of God
        through the giving of himself to the various forms of the <span index="Apostolate">Apostolate</span> proper to the Order.

<h2 class="index">Evangelical Chastity</h2>

<h2 id="art8">Article 8</h2>

<p>
    <span index="Evangelical Chastity">Evangelical purity</span> is a precious gift of grace granted
    by God. (Mat. 19:12; 1 Cor 7:7) The Pauline in willingly vowing chastity is making a conscious
    response to the invitation to perfect charity, at the same time consecrating his whole person to
    the exclusive <span index="Service of God">service of God</span> and neighbour. He binds himself by virtue of his vow of chastity to
    celibacy for the sake of the Kingdom of God. He binds himself likewise to refraining from any
    action, external or interior, which would be contrary to the virtue of chastity, thereby
    imitating the life of <span index="Christ">Christ</span> and his <span index="Mary">Virgin Mother</span>.
</p>

<h2 id="art9">Article 9</h2>

<p>
    Chastity as it is lived in the religious life is a witness to all of the power of the <span index="Holy Spirit">Holy
    Spirit</span>, who is present in the Church. It witnesses also to the possibility of a person&#8217;s mastery
    over himself. It expresses moreover, the superiority of the <span index="Kingdom of God">Kingdom of God</span> to everything
    earthly. It endows one with joy, leads to a fuller life, and encourages one to leading a life of
    moderation according to the demands of the Christian life. The Monk must regard it as an
    obligation to avoid everything, which could in anyway weaken this witness.
</p>

<h2 id="art10">Article 10</h2>

<p>
    Perfect chastity reaches into the very depths of human nature&#8217;s urges. It is necessary,
    therefore, before taking upon oneself the obligations of this type of life of celibacy, that one
    necessarily undergo a period of testing. This will allow both the candidate and the community to
    ascertain whether there is truly a <span index="Monastic Vocation">call to religious</span> Chasity as well as to determine whether the
    necessary psychological and emotional maturity together with the sincerity and the constancy of
    the candidate&#8217;s decision are present.
</p>

<h2 id="art11">Article 11</h2>

<p>
    In living a life of vowed <span index="Evangelical Chastity">Evangelical Purity</span> for God, constant efforts are demanded. The members
    of our <span index="Pauline Community">Pauline Community</span>, all too aware of human weakness, must, therefore, put their trust in
    Divine assistance, practising mortification and guarding of the senses. They renew their desire
    to belong totally to God. They deepen their personal relationship with <span index="Christ">Christ</span> and <span index="Mary">His Mother</span>.
    They seek to live in a sincere brotherly union being on guard against those things, which weaken
    it. They take advantage also of the beneficial counsels and admonitions of their <span index="Confessor">confessors</span> and
    <span index="Spiritual Director">spiritual directors</span> and other persons who are spiritually mature. They dedicate themselves
    wholeheartedly as their strength allows to their daily work in accordance with their personal
    talents and according to the demands of their vocation. They take advantage of all the natural
    means, which would promote good health and would lead to the harmonious development of their
    personality.
</p>

<h2 class="index">Evangelical Poverty</h2>

<h2 id="art12">Article 12</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Through the <span index="Vow">Vow</span> of <span index="Evangelical Poverty">Poverty</span>, the Pauline renounces
        his right to possess material property. He
        renounces also his right to control personal property and subjects himself to the will of
        the Superior as to the use of material goods.
    </li>

    <li>The entire Order, its Provinces and Houses, by virtue of being public judicial persons, by
        virtue of the law itself is capable of acquiring, owning and administrating as well as
        alienating <span index="Material goods">material goods</span>. It is concerned also with acquiring material means which are
        necessary for the living of a common life, for the worthy expectation of <span index="Divine Worship">Divine Worship</span> as
        well as providing for a means of giving charitable assistance.
    </li>

    <li>The property of the Order belongs to the <span index="Pauline Community">entire community</span>. Property includes the following:
        all things moveable and immovable belonging to each individual House, Province, and the
        General Curia; all the belongings of each Monk which became property of the Order by virtue
        of <span index="Religious Profession!Perpetual">Perpetual Profession</span> as well as offerings and income acquired by the Monks, either
        individually or collectively through whatever means, inheritance money, pensions, grants or
        allowances, or insurance. (Can. 668. &#167; 3)
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>
            Before making First Profession of vows the <span index="Novitiate">Novice</span> may choose whomever he wills to take
            charge of the administration of his possessions. Such a person according to the will of the
            Novice may manage his affairs as to the use and profit from material goods during the time
            of <span index="Religious Profession!Temporary">Temporary Profession</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            By Virtue of <span index="Religious Profession!Perpetual">Solemn Profession</span> however, the one taking <span index="Vow">vows</span>, in accordance with the precepts of
            law should give up his property and may do so for whose benefit he wishes on condition however,
            that Profession flows. (Can. 688, &#167; 1 &#167; 2)
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="art13">Article 13</h2>

<p><span index="Evangelical Poverty">Evangelical Poverty</span> consists in having a share in the salvific self-emptying of <span index="Christ">Christ</span>. In order
    to bring this about, the Pauline assists the whole of creation in being freed from slavery (Rom
    8:21) thereby imitating the love of Christ. By this means, he gives witness to Christ&#8217;s love to
    all people especially to the poor and suffering. Poverty willingly embraced frees the heart from
    riches, which pass away; it frees one from excessive worry and leads one to experience the
    freedom of the sons of God. It inclines one also to use the things of this world in accordance
    with <span index="God&#8217;s Will">God&#8217;s will</span>.
</p>

<h2 id="art14">Article 14</h2>

<p>The members of our Order should make it their concern to give both collective and individual
    witness to Evangelical Poverty. This is done by holding all material things in common through a
    modest and economical lifestyle, as regarding residence, clothing, food and rest, according to
    the economic and cultural conditions of the society in which they live and work. This witness is
    given also by avoiding all manner of luxury through the avoidance of the desire for excessive
    gain and accumulation of goods (Can. 634, &#167; 2) also by bearing without complaint the various
    lacks and inconveniences of life. Besides this, the Houses, which are materially endowed, should
    eagerly assist those, which are poorer as well as being willing to assist the Church at large.
</p>

<h2 id="art15">Article 15</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Evangelical Poverty is also evidenced by undertaking the duty and responsibility of work on
        the part of each member of the <span index="Pauline Community">Pauline Community</span>. It is through work that we are able to
        acquire the necessary means for both the support and the continuation of the activities
        proper to the Order. Work, furthermore, is a means for developing personality and the
        faculty of serving one&#8217;s neighbour. Through works, we are co-operators with God in bringing
        to perfection the things, which he has created, and at the same time, we join ourselves to
        the salvific work of Christ who endowed work with a special dignity through his own life. As
        a result, we consecrate to God all our whole strength, all our talents, and our time gladly
        enduring all the difficulties associated with the various activities, which are part of our
        calling. Putting aside excessive concern as to material means, we entrust ourselves to the
        providence of our <span index="Heavenly Father">Heavenly Father</span>. ( Mat. 6:25)
    </li>
    <li>Our <span index="Habit">religious habit</span>, which is a symbol of our Consecration to
        Christ and a witness to
        poverty, according to long-standing tradition is made of white material. This habit is used
        everywhere but especially within the <span index="Cloister">cloister</span>, the <span index="Church Building">church</span> and wherever we appear officially
        as members of the Pauline Order. Besides this, it is necessary to take into account the
        regulation of the local Church as well as the directives of our <span index="General Chapters">General chapters</span> or
        <span index="Provincial Chapters">Provincial Chapters</span>.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2 class="index">Religious Obedience</h2>

<h2 id="art16">Article 16</h2>

<p>
    With his attention fixed on the <span index="Religious Obedience">obedient</span> Christ, the Pauline Monk submits to his superiors,
    thereby making a sacrifice of his own free will. Thus, he unites himself more permanently and
    securely with the saving <span index="God's Will">will of God</span>. Through this means, he strives for perfect charity and is
    of service to people leading them to serve our <span index="Heavenly Father">Heavenly Father</span>.
</p>

<h2 id="art17">Article 17</h2>

<p>
    <span index="Religious Obedience">Religious obedience</span> consists in submitting one&#8217;s will
    to one&#8217;s <span index="Superior">superior</span> on account of God in those matters which concern themselves either directly or
    indirectly to the <span index="Religious Life">religious life</span> according to the <span index="Constitutions">Constitutions</span>. In this way, religious
    obedience leads to a fuller and more willing surrender of energy and talent to a faithful and
    creative living out of the <span index="Mission">mission</span> of the Order and the Church.
</p>

<h2 id="art18">Article 18</h2>

<p>
    The role of authority in the Pauline Order is to be considered a service to the <span index="Pauline Community">Community</span>, made
    in charity. It is the role of the <span index="Superior">Superior</span> to help in the discerning of <span index="God's Will">God&#8217;s will</span>. In this way,
    the Superior represents the Will of God to each Monk. It is his duty, by personal example to be
    a source of encouragement in leading a faithful and dedicated life as expressed in the <span index="Mission">mission</span>
    of the Order. He fulfils this obligation with proper regard and respect for the freedom and
    dignity of the members forming the Community as well as within the framework of the Order&#8217;s law,
    however, without any prejudice to his own authority as to deciding and commanding.
</p>

<h2 id="art19">Article 19</h2>

<p>
    The <span index="Pauline Order">Pauline Order</span> and each of its members, following as the example of the <span index="Mary">Handmaiden</span> of the
    Lord (Lk 1:38) should live in the holy bonds of charity, obedience and service to both the
    universal and particular churches among which we fulfil our mission. The highest authority in
    our Order is the successor of St. Peter to whom we are in a special way obedient by virtue of
    the <span index="Religious Obedience">Vow of Obedience</span>. (Can. 590 &#167;2)
