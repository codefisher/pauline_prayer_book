<h1 class="index">Chapter II: General Norms for Superiors</h1>


<h2 id="art112">Article 112</h2>

<p>
    Superiors receive their authority from God through the Church. They receive this authority so
    that in accordance with God&#8217;s Will they might be able to serve the Community according to the
    Law of our Order.
</p>
<p>
    In exercising their authority to decide and to command, they should be mindful of the respect
    due to the human dignity of their confreres. Their attitude toward them should be as toward sons
    of God, who find themselves on the path of a freely chosen and zealous obedience, which in turn
    leads to growth in charity and participation in the development of the Order and the Church.
</p>

<h2 id="art113">Article 113</h2>


<ol>
    <li> Our Superiors concerned that while leading others they themselves should not be rejected,
        should undertake their office as Superior with true fear and must sincerely pray for the
        gift of wisdom. It should be their concern also by their very manner of being to express
        that love which God has for His chosen. Through diligent study, they should come to know
        their responsibilities in order to be able to faithfully carry them out in the spirit of our
        Constitutions.
    </li>
    <li>
        Superiors in our Order are to have their own councils, in accordance with the
        constitutions. In accordance with the traditions of the Order, to them belongs the right
        to vote with them.
    </li>
    <li>
        All Superiors are to make the Profession of Faith according to the formula Approved by
        the Apostolic See (Can 833).
    </li>
</ol>
