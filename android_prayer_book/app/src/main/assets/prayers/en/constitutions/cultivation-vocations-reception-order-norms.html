<h1 class="index">Chapter I: Fostering Vocations and Reception to the Order</h1>


<h2 id="norm72">Norm 72</h2>

<p>
    Each Pauline Community must pray for many solid Vocations to the Order especially during the
    noon adoration of the most Blessed Sacrament. Moreover, Superiors are responsible for arranging
    in each of our Churches a designated week and specified days of prayer for Vocations.
</p>

<h2 id="norm73">Norm 73</h2>

<p>
    The Major Superior is to appoint a director of Vocations for the whole Order. The scope of his
    activities is that described by the instruction of the commission for priestly and Religious
    Vocations.
</p>

<h2 id="norm74">Norm 74</h2>

<p>
    This official director cooperates with the Major Superior in organizing and coordinating
    activities, which would foster Vocations in each of our monasteries. It is imperative that this
    director enjoy the full cooperation of all the Monks but especially of the following: Youth
    ministry, Catechists, and those in charge of altar servers as well as confessors and retreat
    masters. They should strive to point out both to young people and their parents the importance
    and dignity of a Vocation to the priesthood and Religious Life at the same time giving them
    suggestions as to how to cultivate such a Vocation.
</p>
<p>
    In our concern for the growth of the Order we must take advantage of every occasion which would
    allow for the fostering of Vocations especially Religious celebrations such as the profession of
    Vows, priestly ordinations, first Masses and the like.
</p>


<h2 id="norm75">Norm 75</h2>

<p>
    Candidates seeking admission to our Order should present the following documents:
</p>

<ol class="alph">
    <li> The letter of petition for admission;</li>
    <li> Personal identification and documents pertaining to military service;</li>
    <li> Copy of their birth record as well as baptismal and confirmation certificates;</li>
    <li> A letter of recommendation from their Parish Priest or catechist;</li>
    <li> School records and if the case warrants, records of their past employment;</li>
    <li> Medical records;</li>
    <li> A hand written autobiography;</li>
    <li> A completed questionnaire;</li>
    <li> Three photographs</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="norm76">Norm 76</h2>

<p>
    The decision whether or not to receive a candidate into postulancy preceding novitiate is made
    by the Major Superior having first examined the aforementioned documents.
</p>
<p>
    Upon admission, the candidate is to submit a handwritten declaration attesting to the fact that
    he enters the Order freely. In the event that he leaves the Order for whatever reason, he will
    not be entitled to any form of remuneration for the time spent or work done in the Monastery.
</p>

<h2 id="norm77">Norm 77</h2>

<p>
    The period of postulancy is under the direction of a Prefect who has been appointed by the Major
    Superior according to instructions approved by the same Major Superior.
    The Prefect of postulancy in his concern for the spiritual formation of the candidates should
    take care first of all to become acquainted with their intellectual and moral dispositions as
    well as their professional qualifications. He should pay careful attention especially to the
    neuro-psychic state as borne out by their psychological examinations.
</p>
<p>
    It is his responsibility
    to train them in the process of self-development as well as acquainting them with the more
    important obligations of Religious Life so that the candidate might be able to make a conscious
    and free decision in answering the call of God.
</p>
<p>
    Toward the end of postulancy he is to send the Major Superior a comprehensive report together
    with his own opinion on each individual candidate.
