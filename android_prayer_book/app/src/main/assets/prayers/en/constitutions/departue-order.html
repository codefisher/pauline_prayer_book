<h1 class="index">Chapter X: Departure from the Order &amp; Separation of Members from the
    Community</h1>


<h2 id="art182">Article 182</h2>

<p>
    Our response to the Christ who has called us was a conscious and freely made act of Religious
    Profession at which time we stated our decision to persevere in the Community in accordance with
    that call.
</p>
<p>
    We believe that the grace of perseverance comes from God and that it is necessary to pray for
    this gift with heart and soul. The Lord does not refuse those who cooperate with his grace.
</p>
<p>
    We are able to surmount the difficulties which we meet on the road of monastic life both in
    ourselves and in our brethren through prayer and through mutual assistance.
</p>


<h2 id="art183">Article 183</h2>

<p>
    Professed members of our Order are free to leave the Order when the time of Temporary Profession
    has expired.
</p>
<p>
    For a good reason Major Superiors are authorized to refuse admission to renewal of Temporary
    Profession or to the making of Solemn Profession after consultation with their Council (Art.
    130, &#167;. 1, #2).
</p>


<h2 id="art184">Article 184</h2>


<ol>
    <li> During the time of Temporary profession, whoever asks to leave the Order may do so, so long
        as the Major superior after listening to his Council recognizes the reason for such a
        request to be sufficient. (Can. 688).
    </li>

    <li> Physical or psychological illness even if it is contracted after profession constitutes a
        sufficient reason for an individual&#8217;s not being admitted to the renewal of Temporary
        Profession or from making Solemn Profession if as a result of this sickness in the opinion
        of experts the sickness renders the member unsuited to lead Religious Life. The same does
        not apply, however, if the infirmity was incurred because of negligence on the part of the
        Order or through work performed in the Order (Can 689,&#167;. 2).
    </li>

    <li> If a Monk becomes insane while in Temporary Profession even though unable to make a new
        profession he cannot be dismissed from the Order(Can 689, &#167;. 3).
    </li>


</ol>

<h2 id="art185">Article 185</h2>


<ol>
    <li> After making Solemn profession a Monk may request an indult for leaving the Order only for
        serious reasons after having examined himself before God. He should make his request to the
        Superior General who in turn will transmit it to the Apostolic See joining to it his own
        opinion together with the opinion of his Council (Can. 691, &#167;. 1).
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            An indult legitimately granted which allows for leaving the Order and made known to the
            member brings with it by the law itself a dispensation from Vows and from all
            obligations arising from profession.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Monk, however, may refuse the indult at the time of notification.
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>




<h2 id="art186">Article 186</h2>


<ol>
    <li>
        <p>
            When serious reason demands it the Superior General with the consent of his council is
            able to grant a Monk in Solemn Vows an indult of exclaustration for a period not to
            exceed three years.
        </p>
        <p>
            Extending the indult is reserved to the Apostolic See (Can. 686, &#167;. 1).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li> At the request of the Superior General with the consent of his council exclaustration may
        also be imposed. The indult, however, is granted only by the Apostolic See. Grave reasons
        must be present with justice and charity being preserved (Can. 686, &#167;. 3).
    </li>
    <li> The Monk who has received exclaustration continues to remain subject to his Superiors and
        to the local Ordinary if, he is a cleric. He is bound also to observe any conditions, which
        have been spelled out in the indult of exclaustration. However, he lacks any active or
        passive voice. (Can.687).
    </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="art187">Article 187</h2>


<ol>
    <li>
        <p>
            The Superior General with the deciding consent of his Council is able to dismiss one in
        Temporary Vows even though the time for those vows has not yet expired. This decision should
        be made on solid grounds. Consideration should also be given to the opinion of the Superior
        and Community of the House in which the professed member lived as well as the opinion of the
        educational council in the case of one who is a cleric.
        </p>
        <p>
            If it is determined that a member lacks the qualifications which are demanded by the
            Constitution this is sufficient reason for dismissal. The same obtains in matters regarding
            serious violations of the Constitutions and incorrigibility (Can. 696, &#167;. 2).
        </p>

    </li>
    <li> In the case of dismissing a Monk in Temporary Vows the same procedure should be used as in
        the case of dismissing one who was in Solemn Vows (Can. 697, 699-700).
    </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="art188">Article 188</h2>

<p>
    A professed member may be dismissed from the Order for the following reasons:
</p>

<ol class="arabic">
    <li> By virtue of the law itself;</li>
    <li> Through the commission of transgressions specified in canon law;</li>
    <li> For other serious reasons which demand the process as explained below.</li>

</ol>

<h2 id="art189">Article 189</h2>

<p>
    A member is held to be ipso facto dismissed who;
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Notoriously abandoned the Catholic faith;
    </li>
    <li>
        Has entered the married state or has attempted to marry even civilly.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    In these, the Major Superior together with his council after gathering evidence should without
    delay issue a declaration of the fact and of the defacto dismissal (Can. 694).
</p>

<h2 id="art190">Article 190</h2>

<p>
    A Monk who is guilty of any transgressions mentioned in Canons 1395, 1397, 1398 should be
    dismissed,
</p>
<p>
    In such cases the Major Superior having gathered corroborating evidence and proof of culpability
    should confront the accused Monk who is about to be dismissed giving him the opportunity to
    defend himself.
</p>
<p>
    The Major Superior and secretary should sign the accusation itself together with proof of
    offenses committed.
</p>
<p>
    Documents containing the response and explanations offered by the accused Monk and signed by him
    should be included in the documents of the Superior General.
</p>


<h2 id="art191">Article 191</h2>

<p>
    A Monk may also be dismissed for other reasons if they are serious and have been juridically
    proven (Can. 696, &#167;. 1). Such reasons include:
</p>

<ol class="arabic">
    <li> the habitual neglect of the obligations of religious life;</li>
    <li> The repeated breaking of monastic vows;</li>
    <li> Persistent disobedience to the legitimate order of superiors in serious matter;</li>
    <li> Any kind of scandal which is caused through sinful conduct;</li>
    <li> Stubborn adherence to and spreading of doctrine which has been condemned by the teaching
        authority of the church;
    </li>
    <li> By publicly embracing the ideologies of materialism and atheism;</li>
    <li> Illegitimately leaving a monastic house (Can.655, &#167;. 2) for a period of six months:</li>
    <li> Disturbing unity and fraternal charity (Can. 696, &#167;. 1)</li>
</ol>

<p>
    In these instances, the process for dismissing the monk should begin in conformity with the
    norms set down in law (Can. 697 &amp; 700).
</p>


<h2 id="art192">Article 192</h2>

<p>
    The Vows, rights and obligations assumed at profession cease with the legitimate dismissal of a
    monk with the exception of those, which derive from Holy Orders (Can. 701).
</p>


<h2 id="art193">Article 193</h2>

<p>
    In the case of serious exterior scandal or very grave imminent harm to the Community a member
    can be immediately expelled by the Major Superior or if there is danger in delay by the Prior
    with the consent of the council.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
    If it is necessary the process of dismissal should be begun according to the norm of law or the
    matter should be referred to the Apostolic See (Can. 704).
</p>


<h2 id="art194">Article 194</h2>

<p>
    Those including Novices and candidates who have in any manner whatsoever left our Community or
    have been dismissed from it can request nothing from it for any work done while in the Order.
</p>
<p>
    The fraternal charity in our Community, however, and justice, would urge us to assist them in
    their new way of life within our means (Can. 702, &#167; 2).
</p>
<p>
    Our Monks should treat all those who at one time were part of our Community with kindness and
    understanding in the Lord and should pray for them.
