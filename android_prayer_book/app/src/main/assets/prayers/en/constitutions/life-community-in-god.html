<h1 class="index">Chapter III: The Life of the Community in God</h1>

<h2 class="index">Section I: The Liturgical Life</h2>

<h2 id="art20">Article 20</h2>

<p>
    The Sacred Liturgy is the very summit towards which all activity of the Church is directed and
    at the same time is the very source from which flows its strength. It becomes for us the power
    to live a life according to the Evangelical Counsels and is an effective help in bringing to
    reality the Mission of our religious community within the Church of God.
</p>

<p>
    Through the Word of God, the Eucharistic Sacrifice, the Sacraments, and the Liturgy of the
    Hours, Christ continues his priestly ministry effecting our salvation and glorifying the Father.
    This is the very goal of our own ministry.
</p>


<h2 id="art21">Article 21</h2>


<p>
    The Celebration of the Eucharist is the very centre of our whole community life. It is also the
    source of the perfecting of our fraternal unity. Through our actual and conscious participation
    in the saving Paschal sacrifice, we obtain the strength to carry out our apostolic work. We are
    also strengthened in the hope of final perseverance in doing good as we await the Coming of the
    Lord.
</p>

<p>
    For this reason we gather daily for the Conventual Mass so that we may as a Community experience
    with the Lord all the events of our life; likewise, we receive the Body of Christ and adore Him
    present in the Sacrament. (Cf Can. 663 &#167; 2)
</p>

<p>
    All member of the Community should prepare themselves for a worthy celebration of the
    Eucharistic Sacrifice and for a proper participation in it, especially through the morning
    mediation and the Liturgy of the Hours; we take care to offer a suitable thanksgiving
    afterwards. (Can. 909)
</p>


<h2 id="art22">Article 22</h2>


<p>
    Responsible for our religious community&#8217;s growth in holiness, yet mindful each of our own
    sinfulness, in accordance with the needs of conscience we take care to partake at least twice a
    month the Mercy of God in the Sacrament of Penance. It is in this way that our way of thinking,
    our very attitude changes to that of Christ. We actually become &#8220;the new man&#8221; and in this way,
    we see brought to reality the words of the Apostle: &#8220;Now I live, not I, but Christ lives in me.&#8221;
    (Gal. 2:20) We examine our conscience daily.
</p>


<h2 id="art23">Article 23</h2>


<p>
    Those Brothers of ours who find themselves seriously sick or in advanced age and especially
    those in danger of death are to be fortified by the Sacrament of the Sick, so that in united
    with Christ who is suffering and saving the world, they are able to attain their salvation and
    by their patient sacrifice are able to help in the salvation of others.
</p>


<h2 id="art24">Article 24</h2>


<p>
    The celebration of the Liturgy of the Hours in choir is one of the principal obligations of our
    Pauline Vocation. Through this action in union with Christ, in the name of the Church and all
    mankind, we render glory to God and intercede for the salvation of the world.
</p>

<p>
    The celebration of the Liturgy of the Hours in common, at their true times of the day,
    sanctifies time, which itself belongs to the Lord. Because of this, all members of the Order are
    bound to the choral celebration of the Liturgy of the Hours.
</p>


<h2 id="art25">Article 25</h2>


<p>
    Conscious of the presence of God in all places it should be our desire to glorify Him in all the
    events of our life. Consequently, we should be most anxious to take advantage of the
    Sacramentals of the Church, and furthermore, should be most anxious to impart them, out of such
    an attitude so that all use of material things might serve in the work of our sanctification and
    in glorifying God.
</p>


<h2 class="index">Section II: The Life of Prayer</h2>


<h2 id="art26">Article 26</h2>

<p>
    We are bound to live in an unceasing relationship with God. We are led to do this through the
    example of St. Paul the First Hermit in his communing alone with God alone. We are further
    encouraged by the tradition of our Fathers, but above all, through the example of Christ at
    Prayer and of His Mother. It is in prayer that we are able to recognise the plan of God for us
    and for the world. We are able to likewise to enter more deeply into the salvific Mystery of
    Christ, thereby becoming joined with the Father in the Holy Spirit in the work of continually
    renewing the face of the earth. By this means, we assist in the building up and the propagation
    of the Kingdom of God on earth.
</p>

<h2 id="art27">Article 27</h2>

<p>
    Authentic dialogue with God, leading to salvation, is made easier by a wholehearted and lively
    love for the Sacred Scriptures, in daily reading and mediation upon them. As we commune with the
    Word of God in a spirit of faith and obedience to God, following the example of Mary, who
    mediated upon the Word of the Lord in her heart and then put it into practice, we are led to a
    higher knowledge of Jesus Christ. (cf: Lk 2:19;Phil 3:8) The Word of God in Scripture is a pure
    and constant source of the Spiritual life and of all our apostolic activity. Let all Brothers
    then, give themselves to the reading of the Sacred Scriptures daily.
</p>


<h2 id="art28">Article 28</h2>

<p>
    Mental Prayer occupies the first place amongst all the various forms of prayer in the life of
    the Pauline Community. It is mental prayer that leads us more deeply into the Mystery of Christ
    and assists us in a fuller and more fruitful sharing in liturgical prayer and most especially in
    the Mystery of the Eucharist. It serves also as an effective means of developing the interior
    life. Likewise, all members of the monastery are to cultivate half an hour mediation in the
    morning. However, the second mediation, a tradition cultivated in the Order, which is to be
    loved as a sign of the Pauline life of: Solus Cum Deo Solo may be substituted, adapting
    according to conditions of place, time and persons. Likewise, individuals as well as entire
    communities must be concerned that each monk is afforded time for this meeting with God.
</p>


<h2 id="art29">Article 29</h2>

<p>
    Members of the Order are obligated to make a six-day retreat each year and are likewise bound to
    one day of recollection per month. The reason for this is to provide us with the means of
    verifying whether our life is in accordance with the Gospel and as a way of strengthening our
    personal relationship with God and bringing to new life our apostolic zeal. it must be our
    concern likewise that there be suitable houses where it is possible in a special way to deepen
    one&#8217;s prayer life or to make a retreat.
</p>


<h2 id="art30">Article 30</h2>

<p>
    Interior recollection and an atmosphere of silence are fundamental conditions for communing with
    God in prayer, for meeting God in the voice of conscience, in the happening of daily living and
    in recognizing the Father as he speaks to us in Christ and through the Church. It is thanks to a
    recollected spirit that we are more easily able to share our communion with God with others.
</p>

<p>
    Recollection in our houses is a great good, which should be carefully guarded by the whole
    community. Keeping silence in defined places and times of the day is everyone&#8217;s duty.
</p>


<h2 id="art31">Article 31</h2>

<p>
    Prayerful dialogue with God is more easily effected through various religious practices and
    pious exercises, which have been universally accepted by the Church as well as in our Order.
    Among these, we single out adoration of The Eucharistic Christ, the reading of Sacred Scripture,
    the study of The Fathers of the Church, as well as the study of outstanding and recognized
    theologians and ascetical writers. Among the rich expressions and forms of Marian piety, we give
    first place to the Rosary, which we pray each day as we meditate on the mysteries of salvation.
    It is necessary to remember however, that the aforementioned practices certainly do not exhaust
    the many possibilities for authentic communion with God.
</p>


<h2 id="art32">Article 32</h2>

<p>
    The members of our Order have the obligation of developing in their personal devotion as well as
    in their Apostolic Activity those devotions, which are proper to our own Pauline Family.
    Consequently, over and above our Marian devotion we should take care especially to foster
    devotion to The Holy Angels and to St. Paul the First hermit, the patron of our Order, whose
    solemnity is observed in all our houses and shrines. It is on that day that we renew our
    religious Profession.

</p>

<h2 class="index">Section III: A life of sacrifice with Christ</h2>

<h2 id="art33">Article 33</h2>

<p>
    A life of penance characterises our Pauline Vocation. It is in this way that we have a share in
    the saving self-emptying of Christ. It is also in this way that we are united with the whole
    Church doing penance and constantly being renewed. It is through penitential works that we are
    lead to turning from sin, to interior change, into becoming the new man as well as being
    strengthened in our desire to belong to God.
</p>


<h2 id="art34">Article 34</h2>

<p>
    Our Fathers showed us how to live the Mystery of the Cross-as expressed in a life of difficulty
    and willingly embraced mortifications. Thus, they became more like the Christ in suffering for
    the sins of the world. Following their example both Chapters and Superiors will determine the
    penitential practices and acts of self-denial as they relate to the actual demands of religious
    life. This applies especially to those days and seasons, which by Church practice have a
    penitential character.
</p>


<h2 id="art35">Article 35</h2>

<p>
    The principal expressions of our life of penance are the following: mortification of the body
    through fast and abstinence, careful vigilance over oneself and persistent study, bearing up
    with opposition, suffering and old age. We must remember also that a spirit of penance is
    demanded by the very practice of the Evangelical Counsels as well as our being faithful to a
    life of prayer and common life. It is demanded also by our involvement in Apostolic Works.
    Besides this, cognizant of the proper signs of the times, we take upon ourselves new forms of
    penance so that we might lead others more effectively to conversion.
</p>
<p>
    We join this attitude of
    penance and mortification to the frequent reception of the Sacrament of Penance (Can. 664). It
    is in this Sacrament that we meet the forgiving Christ as he makes reparation to the Heavenly
    Father for the sins of the world.
</p>


<h2 id="art36">Article 36</h2>

<p>
    Members of the Order observe fast together with abstinence from all meat on all the Fridays of
    Lent.
</p>
<p>
    Abstinence obliges:
</p>
