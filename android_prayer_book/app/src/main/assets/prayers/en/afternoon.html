<h1>2. Afternoon Prayers <span>Adoration of the Most Blessed Sacrament</span></h1>

<p class="instruction">
    After the meal, we process to the Monastery Chapel and
    sing a psalm, a song or any appropriate hymn, related to the
    liturgical season. The Prior starts the singing, or the Subprior, or
    his substitute, either a cantor or an hebdomadarius. The adoration
    of the Blessed Sacrament should begin with an Eucharistic hymn.
    The recitation of the &#8220;Angelus&#8221; (if it were not said earlier) follows.
    After, there is a foreseen time for a particular examination of
    conscience, a prayerful reflection (about 3 minutes) follows.
    Further, in accordance with norm 72 of the Directory, we pray for
    vocations to our Order and for other actual intentions. At the end
    of the adoration it has been proposed to pray the Litanies, for
    example:
