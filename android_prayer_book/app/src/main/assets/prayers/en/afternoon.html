<h1>2. Afternoon Prayers <span>Adoration of the Most Blessed Sacrament</span></h1>

<p class="instruction">
    After the meal, we process to the Monastery Chapel and
    sing a psalm, a song or any appropriate hymn, related to the
    liturgical season. The Prior starts the singing, or the Subprior, or
    his substitute, either a cantor or the antiphonarian. The adoration
    of the Blessed Sacrament should begin with an Eucharistic hymn.
    The recitation of the &#8220;Angelus&#8221; (if it was not said earlier) follows.
    After, there is a foreseen time for a particular examination of
    conscience, a prayerful reflection (about 3 minutes) follows.
    Further, in accordance with norm 72 of the Directory, we pray for
    vocations to our Order and for other actual intentions. At the end
    of adoration it has been proposed to pray a litany, for
    example:
