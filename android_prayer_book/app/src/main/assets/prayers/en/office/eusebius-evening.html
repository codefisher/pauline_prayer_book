    Over all these clothes, to keep them together and complete them, put on love. And may the
    peace of Christ reign in your hearts, because it is for this that you were called together
    as parts of one body. Always be thankful. Let the message of Christ, in all its richness,
    find a home with you. Teach each other, and advise each other in all wisdom. With gratitude
    in your hearts sing psalms and hymns and inspired songs to God.
