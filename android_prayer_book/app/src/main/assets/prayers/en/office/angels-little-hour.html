<h3>Before Noon</h3>


<div><div class="ref">Acts 5:17-20</div><div class="reading">Short Reading</div></div><p>
    The high priest intervened with all his supporters from the party of the Sadducees. Prompted by jealousy, they arrested the apostles and had them put in the common gaol. But at night the angel of the Lord opened the prison gates and said as he led them out, &#8216;Go and stand in the Temple, and tell the people all about this new Life.&#8217;
</p>

<p class="noindent">
    <span><span class="rubric">V.</span> I shall sing to you,my God, in the presence of the angels.
    </span><br/>
    <span><span class="rubric">R.</span> I shall worship in your sanctuary, and bear witness to your name.
</span></p>

<h3>Midday</h3>


<div><div class="ref">Acts 12:7</div><div class="reading">Short Reading</div></div><p>
    Then suddenly the angel of the Lord stood there, and the cell was filled with light. He tapped Peter on the side and woke him. &#8216;Get up!&#8217; he said &#8216;Hurry!&#8217; &#8211; and the chains fell from his hands.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
    <span><span class="rubric">V.</span> The Lord sent his angel,
    </span><br/>
    <span><span class="rubric">R.</span> Who freed me from the power of Herod.
</span></p>

<h3>Afternoon</h3>

<div><div class="ref">Acts 10:3-5</div><div class="reading">Short Reading</div></div><p>
    One day at about the ninth hour he had a vision in which he distinctly saw the angel of God come into his house and call out to him, &#8216;Cornelius!&#8217; He stared at the vision in terror and exclaimed, &#8216;What is it, Lord?&#8217; &#8216;Your offering of prayers and alms&#8217;, the angel answered, &#8216;has been accepted by God. Now you must send someone to Jaffa and fetch a man called Simon, known as Peter.&#8217;
</p>

<p class="noindent">
    <span><span class="rubric">V.</span> The fragrant incense of the prayer of the saints went up in the Lord&#8217;s presence.
    </span><br/>
    <span><span class="rubric">R.</span> It rose up in the sight of God from the angel&#8217;s hand.
