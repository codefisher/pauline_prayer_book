<div><div class="reading">First Reading</div><div class="ref">9:13-18; 10:9-13</div><div>A reading from the Book of Wisdom
</div><div class="rubric" style="text-align:center; font-size:0.8em;"><em>Wisdom guided the righteous man in the upright way.</em></div></div><p>
    &#8216;What man indeed can know the intentions of God?
    Who can divine the will of the Lord?
    The reasonings of mortals are unsure
    and our intentions unstable;
    for a perishable body presses down the soul,
    and this tend of clay weighs down the teeming mind.
    It is hard enough for us to work out what is on earth,
    laborious to know what lies within our reach;
    who, then, can discover what is in the heavens?
    As for your intention, who could have learnt it, had you not granted Wisdom
    and sent your holy spirit from above?
    Thus have the paths of those on earth been straightened
    and men been taught what pleases you,
    and saved by Wisdom.&#8216;
</p>

<p>
    But Wisdom delivered her servants from their ordeals.
    The virtuous man, fleeing from the anger of his brother,
    was led by her along straight paths.
    She showed him the kingdom of God
    and taught him the knowledge of holy things.
    She brought him success in his toil
    and gave him full return for all his efforts;
    she stood by him against grasping and oppressive men
    and she made him rich.
    She guarded him closely from his enemies
    and saved him fro the traps they set for him.
    In an arduous struggle she awarded him the prize,
    to teach him that piety is stronger than all.
</p>

<p>
    She did not forsake the virtuous man when he was sold,
    but kept him free from sin.

<div><div class="reading">Second Reading</div><div>
    Selected passages from the </div><em>Life of Saint Paul the First Hermit</em> by Saint Jerome, priest.
<div class="rubric" style="text-align:center">(Chapters 2.4-7, 9-16, 18)</div><div class="rubric" style="text-align:center; font-size:0.8em;"><em>He passed the rest of his life in prayer and solitude.</em></div></div><p>Under the persecutors, Declus and Valerian, a savage! Tempest ravaged many churches in Egypt and
    the Thebes. At the time that these outrages were being perpetrated in the lower Thebaid, Paul,
    at about the age of sixteen, upon the death of his parents, came into the rich inheritance. His
    sister was already married. He was highly educated not only in Greek but also in Egyptian
    culture and a gentle lad who loved God exceedingly. Until the storm of persecution ceased
    thundering, he lived in seclusion in a more distant villa. But, alas, &#8220;to what dost thou not
    drive the hearts of men, O accursed hunger of gold!&#8221; His own brother-in-law, instead of hiding
    him, plotted to betray the boy. When the prudent young man realised what was happening, he fled
    into the recesses of the mountains, where, awaiting the end of persecution, he made a virtue of
    necessity. After careful examination of his surroundings, he found a rocky ridge at the foot of
    which there was a cave, its opening shut off by a moveable stone. Eagerly, removing the stone he
    came upon a large chamber, open to the sky. The spreading branches of an ancient palm tree
    protected the area. He discovered too, a clear spring. There in this humble dwelling, which he
    grew to love (just as if God Himself had given it to him), he passed the rest of his life in
    prayer and solitude. The palm tree supplied his few needs of food and clothing.
</p>
<p>When Blessed Paul, already one hundred and thirteen years old, was leading a heavenly life on
    earth, and Anthony, a nonagenarian, was tarrying in another solitude, the thought occurred to
    Anthony that no other monk had gone to live in the desert. It was revealed to him sleep,
    however, that another person more worthy than himself, dwelt in the deeper recesses of the
    desert and that it was his duty to seek him out. At the break of dawn, the venerable old man set
    out on his quest &#8211; not knowing which way to go. He discerned not far away a wolf, panting with
    burning thirst. He followed it with his eyes and, when the beast had disappeared from view, he
    approached closer to the spot and tried to peer within the cave, which he had entered. Saint
    Paul firmly barred the entrance to his retreat.
</p>
<p>After the holy kiss, Paul seated himself beside Anthony and spoke thus: &#8220;Behold, the one whom you
    have sought with so much fatigue, tangled grey hair covers an old man with wasted limbs. Behold,
    you see a man soon to return to dust. Tell me, I beg of you, how is man faring in the world? Are
    there new roofs rising in ancient cities? What power rules the world? Are there still some who
    are ensnared by the horror of demons?&#8221; While they were discussing such matters, they noticed a
    fleet raven deposited a whole loaf of bread between them. &#8220;Ah,&#8221; said Paul, &#8220;God has sent us our
    dinner. For sixty years now, I have received a piece of bread every noon. Today, in honour of
    your arrival, Christ has doubled the rations of his disciples.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When day again returned, Blessed Paul spoke thus to Anthony. &#8220;For a long time now, brother, I
    have known that you dwelled in these regions; for a long time, God has promised you to me as a
    companion. Since my hour of eternal sleep has arrived, and because I have always desired to be
    dissolved and to be with Christ; having finished the course&#8230;a crown of justice remains for me.
    You have been sent by God to bury my miserable body, rather, to return earth to earth. I beg of
    you, hasten, if it is not too much to ask, and bring back the cloak which Athanasius the bishop
    gave you, to wrap around my wretched body.&#8221; Anthony was amazed and returned to his monastery,
    his dwelling place. He brought over the cloak from his cell, and set out again on the same road
    by which he had returned. When another day had dawned, he saw Paul, shining in snowy witness,
    ascend into heaven amid host of angels and the choirs of Prophets and Apostles. When he entered
    the cave, he found Paul kneeling, his head erect and his hands raised towards heaven, his body
    lifeless. At first, thinking that he was still alive, he began to pray with him. He realised,
    however, that even the lifeless body of the saint rendered homage to God unto whom all creatures
    live. Thereupon, Anthony wrapped up the body and carried it out the entrance, chanting hymns and
    psalms in the Christian manner. He grieved that he did not an implement to dig a grave. Behold,
    here came two lions, they dropped down at his feet. Then, not far from the corpse, they began to
    scratch the ground with their paws. On the next day, Anthony claimed himself the tunic, which
    the holy man had woven for himself from the leaves of the palm; he always wore Paul&#8217;s tunic on
    the solemn feast of Easter and Pentecost.
</p>
<p>I beg of you, whoever reads this, that you remember the sinner Jerome, who, if God should grant
    him his greatest desire, would much rather choose the tunic of Paul with his merits than the
    purple of kings with their kingdoms.
