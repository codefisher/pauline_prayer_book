    From the Annals, that is </div><em>The chronicles of the renowned Polish Kingdom</em>, of Jan D&#322;ugosz, Canon of the Krakow Cathedral
<div class="rubric" style="text-align:center">(Book X, the Year of Our Lord 1384)</div><div class="rubric" style="text-align:center; font-size:0.8em;"><em>The Virtues of Hedwig were preeminent</em></div></div><!-- By Casimir
<p>
    Elizabeth, Queen of Hungary, the Widow of Ludwig, finally fulfilled her repeated promise to send
    Hedwig, her daughter, to Poland, especially when she saw that it was already a dangerous thing
    for the Poles to prolong their hopes for her arrival. She sent her with a large retinue of lords
    and knights, among which were Cardinal Dimitri the presbyter of the Four Crowns and Archbishop
    of Esztergom and Jan, Bishop of the Khanate, with a magnificent royal expedition adorned with
    gold, silver, vessels and costly robes, jewels, purples and silks.
</p>
<p>
    Upon the news of her arrival, the prelates and Polish Lords, who had already doubted if her
    arrival was to come at all, hurried to meet her and led her with great joy in a ceremonial
    procession of the clergy and all states of life to Krakow. Such was the favour of the prelates
    and Lords of Poland towards her, that with such great and affectionate love, forgetting almost
    their masculine seriousness, did not feel any disgrace in subjection to such a noble and
    virtuous woman.
</p>
<p>
    In fact, this motivated their love and favour; that they did not appoint her a spouse, thinking
    that she herself was enough to rule the kingdom with no need for a husband. Therefore, thus, on
    the fifteenth day of October, on which the Poles celebrate the feast of St. Hedwig, in the
    Cathedral of Krakow, Bodzenta, the archbishop of Gniezno, the Bishop John of Krakow, Jan of the
    See of W&#322;oc&#322;awek and Dobrogost of Poznan, crowned her. They did so in the presence of the
    aforementioned Cardinal Archbishop of Esztergom, and a large gathering of Lords and knights of
    both the Polish and Hungarian kingdoms. They anointed her as the Queen of the Poles, having
    given her total authority to manage the kingdom. That is until she would given a spouse capable
    of ruling.
</p>
<p>
    And no wonder: for they knew that she was well brought up and educated, that in her virtues,
    beauty, charming modesty, splendour of the heart, purity of her renown virginity, and the
    gentleness and sweetness of her morals, greatly outnumber even that of the noblest families.
    They saw in her a rare allure, which naturally adorned her. Learned in the sciences, whilst
    retaining her stateliness she comported herself as a lady, but above all she was temperate and
    modest. Heaven itself endowed Hedwig with these gifts so much so, that never had the world seen
    such a woman, but above all the aforementioned modesty dwelled in her, which is the best
    ornament of a woman. It seemed as though she had drunk in all these virtues with her mother&#8217;s
    milk. Already as a young maiden, she seemed to bear the maturity and wisdom of a matron.
</p>

<p>
    Elizabeth, Queen of Hungary, widow of Ludwig, intended to fulfil her frequent promises about
    assigning her daughter Hedwig to the throne of Poland, for she realised that delaying the hopes
    of the Poles any longer was not possible without causing a crisis. She brought Hedwig over
    herself in a mighty company of nobles and soldiers and especially Demetrius, named after four
    canonised saints, Cardinal Priest and Archbishop of Esztergom, and John, Bishop of the Khanate.
    She brought with her an outstanding collection of royal furnishings, comprising gold, silver,
    vessels and costly robes, jewels and cauldrons. At her arrival, about which they had by now
    practically despaired, the prelates and nobles of Poland competed excitedly to meet her. Their
    hearts bursting with eagerness, they brought her to Krakow. Processions of all the churches and
    persons of every rank and standing poured forth to meet her.
</p>
<p> So great was the affection of the prelates and nobles towards her, so boundless their love,
    that, forgetting they were men, they did not consider it demeaning to obey such a remarkable and
    virtuous woman. Moreover, overcome by their love and affection, they neither granted nor
    procured a spouse for her, as if she herself was up to ruling the Kingdom of Poland on her own,
    without a husband.
</p>
<p> In Krakow Cathedral, on Sunday, the fifteenth day of October, when the feast of Saint Hedwig is
    celebrated by Poles, before Bodzenta, Archbishop of Gniezno, Bishops John of Krakow. John of
    W&#322;oc&#322;awek and Dobrogost of Poznan, and in the presence of the aforementioned Cardinal Archbishop
    of Esztergom, the nobles and the military of each Kingdom, namely Poland and Hungary, in a
    massive crowd with a royal crown they had her installed and consecrated Queen of Poland, endowed
    with plenary power to administer the Kingdom of Poland until such time as a husband was sought
    and provided for her.
</p>
<p> No wonder, for they knew that, from a tender age, she was so trained and reared that her beauty
    was surpassed by honour, her appearance by modesty, her comeliness by virtues, her renown and
    riches by restraint and moderation, her power by gentleness. They saw that, as an uncommonly
    distinguished person, her charm had been a gift of nature. She was moreover learned in
    literature, grounded in moral ways, pleasing not so much for her origin as for her womanly
    dignity, restrained by her nature and outstanding for her natural modesty. By a gift from heaven
    she had acquired a greater and more attractive beauty to which no age could object: chastity, a
    unique honour and adornment for married women. It was considered that all manner of virtues were
    instilled in her right from the cradle, along with the nourishment of milk. After leaving the
    years of childhood, she grew in wisdom in such a mature and responsible way that all her words
    and actions seemed to flow from the seriousness of a woman advanced in years.
