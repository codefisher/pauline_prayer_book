<h1 class="index"><span class="rubric">June 8</span> <br/> St Thecla, Virgin and Martyr</h1>

<h2><span class="rubric">Optional Memorial</span></h2>

<p><em>
    Tecla is thought to have come from Iconium. She was said to have received Baptism from St Paul
    the Apostle during his first journey through Asia Minor (the years 45-49). She made a vow of
    Chasity and remained unmarried. She accompanied St Paul in his journeys, ministering to him. She
    is supposedly to have lived long life, well into her 80s, of which she spent a significant
    amount as a hermit.

<div><div class="reading">Second Reading</div><div>
    From </div><em>Concerning Virgins</em> by Saint Ambrose of Milan, Bishop
<div class="rubric" style="text-align:center">(De virginibus II, 19-21)</div><div class="rubric" style="text-align:center; font-size:0.8em;"><em>The Blessed Virgin Mary teaches us how to live, and Saint Thecla how we must depart from life</em></div></div><!-- http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/34072.htm -->

<p>
    Let, then, holy Mary instruct you in the discipline of life, and Thecla teach you how to be
    offered, for she, avoiding nuptial intercourse, and condemned through her husband's rage,
    changed even the disposition of wild beasts by their reverence for virginity. For being made
    ready for the wild beasts, when avoiding the gaze of men, she offered her vital parts to a
    fierce lion, caused those who had turned away their immodest looks to turn them back modestly.
</p>
<p>
    The beast was to be seen lying on the ground, licking her feet, showing without a sound that it
    could not injure the sacred body of the virgin. So the beast reverenced his prey, and forgetful
    of his own nature, put on that nature which men had lost. One could see, as it were, by some
    transfusion of nature, men clothed with savageness, goading the beast to cruelty, and the beast
    kissing the feet of the virgin, teaching them what was due from men. Virginity has in itself so
    much that is admirable, that even lions admire it. Food did not induce them though kept without
    their meal; no impulse hurried them on when excited; anger did not exasperate them when stirred
    up, nor did their habits lead them blindly as they were wont, nor their own natural disposition
    possess them with fierceness. They set an example of piety when reverencing the martyr; and gave
    a lesson in favor of chastity when they did nothing but kiss the virgin's feet, with their eyes
    turned to the ground, as though through modesty, fearing that any male, even a beast, should see
    the virgin naked.
</p>
<p>
    Some one will say: &#8220;Why have you brought forward the example of Mary, as if any one could be
    found to imitate the Lord's mother? And why that of Thecla, whom the Apostle of the Gentiles
    trained? Give us a teacher of our own sort if you wish for disciples.&#8221; I will, therefore, set
    before you a recent example of this sort, that you may understand that the Apostle is the
    teacher, not of one only, but of all.
