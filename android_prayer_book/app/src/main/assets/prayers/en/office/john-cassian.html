<h1 class="index"><span class="rubric">February 25</span> <br/> St John Cassian, Abbot</h1>

<h2><span class="rubric">Memorial</span></h2>

<p><em>
    John Cassian was born around 360 AD, most likely in modern Romania. When he was 20, he came to
    Palestine and became a monk in one of the monasteries in Bethlehem. Next, he spent 10 years in
    Egypt among the monks there, where he came to know renowned masters of the eremitical life. Then
    in the years following he lived in Rome. There he received priestly orders and befriended the
    future Pope Leo the Great. Around 415, he founded two monasteries, one for monks (St Victor&#8217;s)
    and another for Virgins (The Saviour&#8217;s).

    A reading from </div><em>Conferences of the Fathers</em> by Saint John Cassian, priest and abbot.
<div class="rubric" style="text-align:center">(Liber III, Conlatio XVIII, 6)</div><div class="rubric" style="text-align:center; font-size:0.8em;"><em>Of the system of the Anchorites and its beginning.</em></div></div><!-- Text copied from: http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/350818.htm -->

<p>
    Out of this number of the perfect, and, if I may use the expression, this most fruitful root of
    saints, were produced afterwards the flowers and fruits of the anchorites as well. And of this
    order we have heard that the originators were those whom we mentioned just now; viz., Saint Paul
    and Antony, men who frequented the recesses of the desert, not as some from faint heartedness,
    and the evil of impatience, but from a desire for loftier heights of perfection and divine
    contemplation, although the former of them is said to have found his way to the desert by reason
    of necessity, while during the time of persecution he was avoiding the plots of his neighbours.
    So then there sprang from that system of which we have spoken another sort of perfection, whose
    followers are rightly termed anchorites; i.e., withdrawers, because, being by no means satisfied
    with that victory whereby they had trodden under foot the hidden snares of the devil, while
    still living among men, they were eager to fight with the devils in open conflict, and a
    straightforward battle, and so feared not to penetrate the vast recesses of the desert,
    imitating, to wit, John the Baptist, who passed all his life in the desert, and Elijah and
    Elisha and those of whom the Apostle speaks as follows: &#8220;They wandered about in sheepskins and
    goatskins, being in want, distressed, afflicted, of whom the world was not worthy, wandering in
    deserts, in mountains and in dens and in caves of the earth.&#8221; (Heb. 11:37-38) Of whom too the Lord speaks
    figuratively to Job: &#8220;But who has sent out the wild ass free, and who has loosed his bands? To
    whom I have given the wilderness for a house, and a barren land for his dwelling. He scorns the
    multitude of the city and hears not the cry of the driver; he looks round about the mountains of
    his pasture, and seeks for every green thing.&#8221; (Job 39:5-7) In the Psalms also: &#8220;Let now the redeemed of the
    Lord say, those whom He has redeemed from the hand of the enemy;&#8221; (Ps. 100:2) and after a little: &#8220;They
    wandered in a wilderness in a place without water: they found not the way of a city of
    habitation. They were hungry and thirsty: their soul fainted in them. And they cried unto the
    Lord in their trouble and He delivered them out of their distress;&#8221; (Ps 106:4-6) whom Jeremiah too describes
    as follows: &#8220;Blessed is the man that has borne the yoke from his youth. He shall sit solitary and
    hold his peace because he has taken it up upon himself,&#8221; and there sing in heart and deed these
    words of the Psalmist: &#8220;I have become like a pelican in the wilderness. I watched and have become
    like a sparrow alone upon the house-top.&#8221; (Ps 101:7-8)
