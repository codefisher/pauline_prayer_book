<h2><span class="rubric">Memorial</span></h2>

<p><em>
    Mary was born in Egypt between the fourth and sixth Centuries. At age twelve, she ran away from home and
    gave herself to loose living. After a sin-filled seventeen years, when she could not enter the Church
    of the Holy Sepulchre she converted and abandoned her life thus far. She left for the Jordan
    Desert, where she spent many penitential years in solitude, with various mortifications and
    fasts.

    She said to him, &#8220;Believe me, Abba, seventeen years I passed in this desert fighting wild beasts
    &#8212; mad desires and passions. When I was about to partake of food, I used to begin to regret the
    meat and fish of which I had so much in Egypt. I regretted also not having wine which I
    loved so much. For I drank a lot of wine when I lived in the world, while here I had not even
    water. I used to burn and succumb to thirst. The mad desire for profligate songs also entered
    me and confused me greatly, edging me on to sing satanic songs which I had learned once. But
    when such desires entered me I struck myself on the breast and reminded myself of the vow which
    I had made when going into the desert. In my thoughts I returned to the icon of the Mother of
    God which had received me and to her I cried in prayer. I implored her to chase away the
    thoughts to which my miserable soul was succumbing. And after weeping for so long and beating my
    breast, I used to see light at last which seemed to shine on me from everywhere. And after the
    violent storm, lasting calm descended.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
    &#8220;And how shall I tell you, O Abba, of the thoughts that pushed me towards lust once more? A fire
    was kindled in my miserable heart which seemed to burn me up completely and to awake in me a
    thirst for embraces. As soon as this craving came to me, I flung myself on the earth and watered
    it with my tears, as if I saw before me my witness, who had appeared to me in my disobedience,
    and who seemed to threaten punishment for the crime. And I did not rise from the ground
    (sometimes I lay thus prostrate for a day and a night) until a calm and sweet light descended
    and enlightened me and chased away the thoughts that possessed me. But always I turned to the
    eyes of my mind to my Protectress, asking her to extend help to one who was sinking fast in the
    waves of the desert. And I always had her as my Helper and the Accepter of my repentance. And
    thus I lived for seventeen years amid constant dangers. And since, then even till now, the Mother
    of God helps me in everything and leads me, as it were, by the hand.&#8221;
</p>

    Zosima asked, &#8220;Can it be that you did not need food and clothing?" She answered, "After
    finishing the loaves I had, of which I spoke, for seventeen years I have fed on herbs and all
    that can be found in the desert. The clothes I had when I crossed the Jordan became torn and
    worn out. I suffered greatly from the cold and greatly from the extreme heat. At times the sun
    burned me up and at other times I shivered from the frost, and frequently falling to the ground
    I lay without breath and without motion. I struggled with many afflictions and with terrible
    temptations. But from that time till now the power of God in numerous ways had guarded my sinful
    soul and my humble body. When I only reflect on the evils from which Our Lord has delivered me, I
    have imperishable food for hope of salvation. I am fed and clothed by the all-powerful Word of
    God, the Lord of all. For it is not by bread alone that man lives. And those who have stripped
    off the rags of sin have no refuge, hiding themselves in the clefts of the rocks&#8221; (Job 24; Heb
    11:38).
