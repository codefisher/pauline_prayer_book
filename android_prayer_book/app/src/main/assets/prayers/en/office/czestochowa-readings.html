<div><div class="reading">First Reading</div><div class="ref">3:22-4:7</div><div>
    A reading from the letter of St Paul to the Galatians
</div></div><p>
    Scripture represents us all as under the bondage of sin; it was faith in Jesus Christ that was
    to impart the promised blessing to all those who believe in him. Until faith came, we were all
    being kept in bondage to the law, waiting for the faith that was one day to be revealed. So that
    the law was our tutor, bringing us to Christ, to find in faith our justification. When faith
    comes, then we are no longer under the rule of a tutor; through faith in Christ Jesus you are
    all now God&#8217;s sons. All you who have been baptised in Christ&#8217;s name have put on the person of
    Christ; no more Jew or Gentile, no more slave and freeman, no more male or female; you are all
    one person in Jesus Christ. And if you belong to Christ, then you are indeed Abraham&#8217;s children;
    the promised inheritance is yours.
</p>
<p>
    Consider this; one who comes into his property while he is still a child has no more liberty
    than one of the servants, though all the estate is his; he is under the control of guardians and
    trustees, until he reaches the age prescribed by his father. So it was with us; in those
    childish days of ours we toiled away at the schoolroom tasks which the world gave us, till the
    appointed time came. Then God sent out his Son on a mission to us. He took birth from a woman,
    took birth as a subject of the law, so as to ransom those who were subject to the law, and make
    us sons by adoption. To prove that you are sons, God sent out the Spirit of his Son into your
    hearts, crying out in us, Abba, Father. No longer, then, are you a slave, you are a son; and
    because you are a son, you have, by divine appointment, the son&#8217;s right of inheritance.
</p>

<div><div class="reading">Second Reading</div><div>
    From the Homily of St John Paul II for the 600th Anniversary of the Shrine of Jasna Gora
</div></div><p>
    The liturgy above all, distinctly presents the wondrous mystery of the Jasna Gora Shrine, as we
    read the Johannine Gospel account of the wedding feast at Cana. In this Gospel fragment we are
    told of the presence of the Mother of Jesus: &#8220;the Mother of Jesus was there&#8221;, and of the fact
    that Jesus himself and his disciples were invited. The event takes place at the beginning of the
    Son of Mary&#8217;s ministry of teaching, at the beginning of his overall public ministry in Galilee.
</p>
<p>
    This particular Gospel event brings to mind the millennial anniversary of the so-called Baptism
    of Poland. Through this event in 966, through the &#8220;Baptism&#8221;, at the start of our ministry as a
    nation, Jesus Christ was invited to the Fatherland, as if to a Polish Cana. At the same time,
    invited together with him, came Mary. She came and was present together with her Son, as is
    demonstrated by numerous testimonies gathered from the initial first centuries of Christianity
    in Poland, most particularly in the ancient hymn, &#8220;God-bearer&#8221;. In Cana, Mary says to the
    stewards of the feast: &#8220;Do whatever he tells you&#8221;. Beginning from 1382, Mary stands before the
    sons and daughters of this land, before whole generations, and repeats the same words. Jasna
    Gora has become a particular place of evangelisation on our journey. The message of the Good
    News obtains a unique expressiveness here, and simultaneously becomes mediated by Mary as it
    were. Jasna Gora has brought this motherly trait to Polish Christianity and the life of the
    Church in this land, the beginnings of which were closely connected with the events of Cana. Do
    whatever he tells you. And what does Christ tell us? Is it not first of all that which we find
    so tersely expressed in the letter of St Paul to the Galatians? But when the fulness of time had
    come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, to redeem them that were under the
    law, that we might receive the adoption of sons. And because you are sons, God has sent the
    Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father. So through God you are no longer a
    slave, but a son; and if a son, then an heir.
</p>
<p>
    Christ tells us this from one generation to the next. He speaks through all that he does and
    teaches. He speaks especially through he who is. He is the Son of God - and he comes to bestow
    upon us adopted sonship. Having received in the power of the Holy Spirit the dignity of the sons
    of God, in the power of this same Spirit, we say to God: &#8220;Father&#8221;. As sons of God we cannot be
    slaves. Our sonship of God carries within itself an inheritance of freedom.
</p>
<p>
    Christ present together with his Mother in the Polish Cana places before us, from generation to
    generation, the great ideal of freedom. Freedom is given to man by God as a measure of his
    dignity. At the same time it is entrusted to him. &#8220;Freedom is not a relief from hardship, it is
    the hardship of greatness&#8221; says the poet. Man can use freedom well, or abuse it. He can build up
    through it, or destroy. The message of Jasna Gora carries with it an invitation to the
    inheritance of the sons of God. A call to a life of freedom. A summons to use freedom well, to
    build up and not destroy.
</p>
<p>
    This evangelical call of Jasna Gora to a life of freedom worthy of the sons of her Son. This
    same thing happens in Jasna Gora. How many have passed through Jasna Gora these past six
    centuries? How many have converted here, passing from an evil to a wholesome use of their
    freedom? How many have regained the true dignity of the adopted sons of God? How much could the
    Icon of the Black Madonna relate to us all of this? How much could the confessionals of the
    whole Basilica tell us? How many things could the Way of the Cross on the rampart of the Shrine
    reveal? An enormous chapter in the history of human souls. This is perhaps the most fundamental
    dimension of the sixth centenary of Jasna Gora. It has remained and will remain within living
    people, sons and daughters of this land, when God sends into their hearts his Holy Spirit in
    such a way that in all interior truth they can call out: &#8220;Abba, Father!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
    We wish to continue to, in accordance with the word&#8217;s of today&#8217;s Gospel, invite Jesus into the
    life of our Fatherland, in the same way he was invited, together with his Mother, to Cana. We
    say to Christ through Mary: Be with us at every moment! We make this invitation here, at Jasna
    Gora.
</p>
<p>
    Once again we embrace with our gaze and heart our Shrine of Jasna Gora. We listen intently to
    the words of the psalm in today&#8217;s liturgy: &#8220;Go about Sion, count the number of it towers&#8230; so
    that you may tell the next generation, that God is our God for ever&#8221;.
