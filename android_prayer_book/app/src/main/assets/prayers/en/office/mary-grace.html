<div><div class="reading">Second Reading</div><div>
    A reading from the Encyclical Letter </div><em>Redemptoris Mater</em> by St. John Paul II, pope
<div class="rubric" style="text-align:center">(Redemptoris Mater nn. 39. 40-41)</div><div class="rubric" style="text-align:center; font-size:0.8em;"><em>The maternal mediation of the handmaid of the Lord</em></div></div><p>
    Mary&#8217;s motherhood, completely pervaded by her spousal attitude as the &#8220;handmaid of the Lord,&#8221;
    constitutes the first and fundamental dimension of that mediation which the Church confesses and
    proclaims in her regard (LG 62) and continually &#8220;commends to the hearts of the faithful,&#8221; since the
    Church has great trust in her. For it must be recognized that before anyone else it was God
    himself, the Eternal Father, who entrusted himself to the Virgin of Nazareth, giving her his own
    Son in the mystery of the Incarnation. Her election to the supreme office and dignity of Mother
    of the Son of God refers, on the ontological level, to the very reality of the union of the two
    natures in the person of the Word (hypostatic union). This basic fact of being the Mother of the
    Son of God is from the very beginning a complete openness to the person of Christ, to his whole
    work, to his whole mission. The words &#8220;Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord&#8221; testify to Mary&#8217;s
    openness of spirit: she perfectly unites in herself the love proper to virginity and the love
    characteristic of motherhood, which are joined and, as it were, fused together.
</p>

<p>
    Through this &#8220;burning charity,&#8221; which sought to achieve, in union with Christ, the restoration
    of &#8220;supernatural life to souls&#8221; (LG 61), Mary entered, in a way all her own, into the one mediation
    &#8220;between God and men&#8221; which is the mediation of the man Christ Jesus. If she was the first to
    experience within herself the supernatural consequences of this one mediation&#8212;in the
    Annunciation she had been greeted as &#8220;full of grace&#8221;&#8212;then we must say that through this fullness
    of grace and supernatural life she was especially predisposed to cooperation with Christ, the
    one Mediator of human salvation. And such cooperation is precisely this mediation subordinated
    to the mediation of Christ.
</p>

<p>
    In Mary&#8217;s case we have a special and exceptional mediation, based upon her &#8220;fullness of grace,&#8221;
    which was expressed in the complete willingness of the &#8220;handmaid of the Lord.&#8221; In response to
    this interior willingness of his Mother, Jesus Christ prepared her ever more completely to
    become for all people their &#8220;mother in the order of grace.&#8221; This is indicated, at least
    indirectly, by certain details noted by the Synoptics (cf. Lk 11:28; 8:20-21; Mk 3:32-35; Mt
    12:47-50) and still more so by the Gospel of John (cf. 2:1-12; 19:25-27), which I have already
    mentioned. Particularly eloquent in this regard are the words spoken by Jesus on the Cross to
    Mary and John.
</p>

<p>
    With the redeeming death of her Son, the maternal mediation of the handmaid of the Lord took on
    a universal dimension, for the work of redemption embraces the whole of humanity. Thus there is
    manifested in a singular way the efficacy of the one and universal mediation of Christ &#8220;between
    God and men&#8221; Mary&#8217;s cooperation shares, in its subordinate character, in the universality of the
    mediation of the Redeemer, the one Mediator.
</p>

<p>
    The glory of serving does not cease to be her royal exaltation: assumed into heaven, she does
    not cease her saving service, which expresses her maternal mediation &#8220;until the eternal
    fulfillment of all the elect&#8221; (LG 62). Thus, she who here on earth &#8220;loyally preserved in her union
    with her Son unto the Cross,&#8221; continues to remain united with him, while now &#8220;all things are
    subjected to him, until he subjects to the Father himself and all things.&#8221; Thus in her
    Assumption into heaven, Mary is as it were clothed by the whole reality of the Communion of
    Saints, and her very union with the Son in glory is wholly oriented towards the definitive
    fullness of the Kingdom, when &#8220;God will be all in all.&#8221;
