<h2>The Office of Readings</h2>


<div><div class="reading">Second Reading</div><div>
    From the </div><em>Rule</em> and from the <em/> of St. Pachomius, Abbot
<div class="rubric" style="text-align:center">(Exordium Praeceptorum 49 et Monita, PL 23, 73 et 91-92)</div><div class="rubric" style="text-align:center; font-size:0.8em;"><em>Of the ascetic zeal of Monks</em></div></div><!-- Own Translation -->

<p>
    If anyone who comes to the door of the monastery wanting to renounce the world and to be considered
    among the brothers, he will not have the liberty of entering but first they will inform the Father of the monastery.
    The candidate will stay some days outside at the door and they will teach him the Lord&#8217;s Prayer and the psalms,
    as many he is able to learn by heart.  He will give evidence that it is not the chance of some evil committed,
    and troubled in the hour of fear has fled or that he is a slave of someone. And whether he is able to renounce his
    parents, and to value little his own means.
</p>

<p>
    If it is seen that he is attracted to prayer and everything else, they will teach him all the monastic discipline,
    what he is required to observe and what to do, who to serve in either the gathering of the brothers or in the house
    to which he is assigned, or in the order of eating; thus instructed and able to do all good works, let him join the brothers.
    Then he will be divested of his secular clothes and dressed with the habit of the monks.
</p>

<p>
    Let us remain firm and unmoved, that wondering thoughts, which like water boil over, we might curb by constantly meditating on God's law,
    through which the law of carnal concupiscence is torn down, letting us have the strength to seek out all which is pleasing to God: and
    we might be kept unhurt from the world's troubles, and all pride, which is the worst folly and worse then all evils.
    Always having the lord before before our eyes, let us remember his passion, crucifixion and death, by which we were redeemed and live.
    There let us hate the world and all things which are in it, let us even hate all bodily comforts.
    Let us renounce this life, that we are able to live for God.
</p>

<p>
    Therefore let us remember, beloved, our profession, in what manner we promised to be devoted to God:
    for this very thing is what will be required from us on the day of judgement. We bear hunger, thirst, nakedness and keep vigil, and
    singing the psalms and prayers, groaning from the depth of the heart let us pour forth tears; making a careful examination of ourselves,
    if in someway we might come to merit to be worthy of God through his great mercy. Let us not refuse hardships and afflictions, so that
    we might reach the consolation of the repose of the Lord, and we might merit to receive immortal life and eternal repose .
