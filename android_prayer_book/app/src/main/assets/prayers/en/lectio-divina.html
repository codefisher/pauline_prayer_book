<h1>1. A Proposed Mediation</h1>

<p>Having in mind the good of those among us who are in formation, let us use the readings from the lectionary in tome V, from the 33<sup>rd</sup> Week of Ordinary time, year II, Tuesday: Rev 3:1-6;14-22; Ps 15, 1b-3a. 3bc-4.5; Lk 19:1-10.</p>

<p>At the <em>LECTIO</em> stage, in recollection, we familiarise ourselves with the contents of the texts by reading all three pericopes to find a central theme. It is good, in the day before, particularly in the evening before, to read the texts and become familiar with them, so that even before we sleep, we can begin a preliminary meditation on the texts. It is important to note particular details that catch our attention. This work ought to be done in solitude, in accordance with our motto &#8211; Alone with God alone. Our primary focus could be a word, which appears in two or three liturgical readings, or a thought, or a dominating idea throughout the texts. We should not ignore the biblical contexts of the chosen fragments, which we have chosen. The bible too, itself was written for catechetical purposes and does not lack meaningful neighbouring contents. For this proposed meditation, we shall use the concept of <em>seeking God.</em> The reading from revelations encourages us to seek Jesus without fooling ourselves. That by the name, therefore the identity of the one we are seeking would become a reality, which expresses one dead spiritually coming to life. That one masking his poverty and greed would become spiritually wealthy. Frequently an impoverished soul seeks gratification in material opulence. How very high does one have to climb spiritually to fulfil the requirements asked by Psalm 15? Only one honest and free from greed can climb the mountain of the Lord. In the background of these readings is the gospel of St Luke, which already appears as a concrete reality, but not without its mystical shades, become <em>sui generis</em> the matrix of conversion. </p>

<p>Finding all the common themes of the readings &#8211; in this case &#8211; the search for God and not wealth is the first goal of the <em>LECTIO</em> stage. In this stage, we need to mention an additional step: <em>DIVINATIO</em>, that is a deepening of the texts, directed by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. A great help in this stage would be something of a biblical lexicon, a dictionary of symbols, or a biblical concordance. An inestimable treasure here is the knowledge of the original languages. That is why, during our time in the seminary, the <em>ratio studiorum, </em>foresees at least the learning of the Greek language. Using an interlinear version and dictionary not only allows us to find the correct translation of words, but also to find the place in the bible, in which the word occurs, and through a comparison find a broader and fuller meaning of the word. A beneficial practice is the writing down of our meditations, a <em>LECTIO</em> <em>SCRIPTA</em>, for this helps in recollection and, particularly in the morning, fights against distractions, likewise it allows us to practise the style of a future homily. We must not forget that zelous evangelisation is also part of our charism (Pauline Constitutions 3.4). </p>

<p>The third stage is <em>MEDITATIO</em>, that is discursive meditation. This is the leaving behind the continuity of theme, it is an attempt to discern the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, the taking root of the found ideas and a weaving of them together into a complete whole. All the possible thoughts capable of being reflected on should be written down. The act of writing multiplies thoughts and orders them and this in turn causes the meditation to become clear and more easily finds its place in the memory, almost like a seal. The mother of our Lord, when the Angel illuminated the will of God, meditated in her heart, but the original text used the word &#948;&#953;&#945;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#953;&#950;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953; (dialogizomai) which means meditating with care (Mt 6:7-8), with the desire to understand. Moreover, even to attempt to comprehend that which is incompressible or begets fear (Lk 5:21-22), or likewise the internal struggle (Lk 24:38) and finally the ideal that appears from the very depths of the subconscious (Lk 2:35). All these biblical passages concern themselves with an intense discernment, which does not lack internal tension, attempting to understanding with effort, which will lead to an understanding, not only of this Divine mystery, but also our very inner most self, the personal subconscious. <em>MEDITATIO</em> then is the work of the intellect, at such a level, which is achieved thanks to the grace of faith in knowing Jesus Christ, in which the mystery of man becomes known to man himself. </p>

<p> The coincidental text concerning Zacchaeus, is associated liturgically with the reading from Revelations and with Psalm 15, may lead us to our next discovery in this state of MEDITATIO. Psalm 15 for the reader may be similar to a glance in a mirror, because which one of us can climb the mountain of the Lord&#8217;s holiness, searching for Him, without any blemish of sin or fault. The just, speaking not only the truth with the lips, but also with his heart, who of us does not lie, who never harmed anyone, or has not discovered in themselves some greed or some higher aspirations? Zacchaeus was a greedy liar, having committed many frauds and the many people he harmed he held in contempt. His name, Zacchaeus, may be translated as &#8220;pure&#8221; or &#8220;innocent,&#8221; but his life greatly contradicted his name. His personage ideally fits the accusations in the apocalyptic letters address to Laodicea and Sardis, which speak of him who has a name, that means that he is alive, but is in fact dead. He was rich materially, but poor in conscience. Nevertheless, what could save him was the irresistible desire to see Jesus, which he expressed whilst searching for him. &#8220;He wanted to necessarily see Jesus!&#8221; When this happened, Zacchaeus&#8217; life changed dramatically, from a greedy abuser he became a merciful alms giver. Of particular value is the key phrase of &#8220;He wanted to see Jesus.&#8221; A literal translation of the original is &#8220;he sought to see Jesus.&#8221; This searching &#950;&#949;&#964;&#949;&#959; (Zeteo) appears again in the same Gospel of Luke, at this moment, thanks to the Greek dictionary or a biblical concordance. Mary along with Joseph were looking for Jesus in the temple of Jerusalem. After finding him, Mary says: &#8220;Behold, your father and I have been looking for you anxiously.&#8221; (Lk 2:48) Looking in an English &#8211; Greek dictionary, we see, that this word, &#950;&#949;&#964;&#949;&#959; can likewise also mean to discern, therefore to meditate, that is mentally and spiritually attempting to comprehend something. So thus, Mary and Joseph not only were searching for Our Lord in the streets of Jerusalem, but they were also searching for him with their hearts, with their anxious hearts. This unsettling anxiety, accompanies every person, until they find Our Lord. They sought for him with their souls, their thoughts, their emotions with their troubled thoughts. The essence of real mediation is not to contain oneself solely to one&#8217;s half-hour morning or evening meditation, but to personally, most deeply seek to know and to discover the truth not only about our redeemer, but also about ourselves. Setting the bounds of our dialogue with Our Lord in such a way, allows us to adhere to Him and come to love Him more fully. Searching strenuously does not limit itself to only half an hour, but expands itself to seek understanding, in all available aids: beginning firstly from the Fathers of the Church and ending with exegetical commentaries, lexicons and dictionaries, so as to comprehend the scriptures most fully. Following such a comprehension and understanding comes the possibility of drawing closer to Our Lord and only then gives us a chance for love. All evil stems from a focusing on oneself and all good from focusing all ones strength on God. The stage of <em>MEDITATIO</em> can last even a few days, because the consultation of sources and the search of a library may take us quite some time. We should not be restrained only by the morning&#8217;s half hour, but should use every free moment we have to deepen the subject, which we are mediating upon. </p>

<h2>Oratio</h2>

<p>The thorough intellectual study, using all possible sources and means, as mentioned above, open our horizons for the feeling of wonder, sadness, compunction, an honest look at one&#8217;s self and awakens a desire for a better life to the one we have led to this moment. The movements of our emotions, which have accompanied us in our mediation, require us certainly to turn towards God in prayer, in the most personal form of prayer, deep and sincere. The wider the confession, the stronger a bond appears between Our Lord and ourselves. Identifying with Zacchaeus, we climb the Sycamore, which earlier symbolised human pride and the will for power or greed, thanks to the desire of seeing the Lord, becomes and illustration of the ascent to the highest levels of the desire for God, which is capable of changing our entire lives. Prayer in the sighs and words of the spirit in the end transform into the contemplative gazing upon the Lord. Therefore, the next stage of <em>Lectio Divina</em> is <em>CONTEMPLATIO</em>.</p>

<h2>Contemplatio</h2>

<p>In this moment of our mediation, we ought to fall silent in all our dialogues with ourselves and even with the Lord Himself. Placing ourselves before the ineffable Word of God, which did the impossible, became man, and communicated to us the greatest news, pushes man to silence filled with awe and praise. God always remains incomprehensible, even thought He should always be known. St Ephraim the Syrian wrote that to hold that one has understood The Word is the greatest desecration, because it implies the conviction that the knower is greater than the object of the thing known. The stage <em>CONTEMPLATIO</em> allows man to remind himself the seriousness of silence in the presence of the revealed mystery, which will always remind a mystery, regardless of the understanding and insight gained through from Mediation. This stage is good to do in front of the Blessed Sacrament during a time of adoration, which ought to be a natural crowning of a monastic day. Without this gazing into the countenance of Christ, without adoration of the Blessed Sacrament in the atmosphere of the complete morning mediation, <em>As a consequence life itself loses meaning, the faces of brothers and sisters are obscured and it becomes impossible to </em><em>recognise</em><em> the face of God in them. (Starting Afresh from Christ III. 25) </em>Moments of contemplation, which allows us to be raptured into the gaze of the face of the Lord, through the ascent of the sycamore of Zacheus, the whole of our consecrated life is renewed, as St John Paul II expressed on his homily on the 2<sup>nd</sup> of February 2001.</p>

<h2>Pronuntiatio</h2>

<p>The whole material, gathered, written down and ordered within the few days becomes a holy basis, from which we can firstly share with the community in the form of <em>COLLATIO</em>, which springs from the eremitical tradition and later with the faithful in the church during the homily or a spiritual conference. In this way mediation, which begins with being alone with God along, becomes an enrichment to the brothers and finally with the People of God. The instruction of the congregation for institutes of consecrated life, 2002, entitled &#8220;To begin afresh from Christ,&#8221; tells us that consecrated persons only when they are themselves nourished with the Word of God, having become new people, free people, evangelic people and thus so authentic servants in the work of evangelisation and strongly convincing, are able to bring the fruit of our prayers to others. (III, 24) The riches of experience and reflection and finally the treasure of being enraptured by the face of the Lord, after a well prayed mediation, finds its crowning moment in adoring contemplation in His presence in the Blessed Sacrament, begs us to share our experience with others, for we are debtors of the Church noless than Zacchaeus, who promised to repay his debts, in the indebting promise he gave to the Lord. The conciliar decree on the ministry and life of priests, <em>Presbyterorum Ordinis,</em> already in its first chapter, states <em>their ministry, which begins with the evangelical proclamation</em>, although the peak is the leading of someone to the full participation in the Eucharist united with Our Lord. The Council even more insistently reminds the priest of this duty in the fourth point of the second chapter where it states <em>The People of God are joined together primarily by the word of the living God, and rightfully they expect this from their priests.</em> Regardless of this obligation directed to priest, which for better or for worse, eloquently or not so, is always and everywhere to preach the Gospel is not left in any doubt, as to the role of mediation upon the Word of God, which is the first step to evangelisation. </p>

<p>If Zacchaeus did not climb the sycamore, to see Jesus, a great many people would not have been repaid or enriched by him. If a monk does not consciously strive to mediation, which is like climbing the tree of coming to the knowledge of one true and good God, a great many people would not have the debt of their salvation repaid. Zacchaeus gave half his wealth to the poor and those harmed by him were quadrupolly repaid. Sharing the wealth of mediation allows the church to be rewarded and enriched with the treasure of the wisdom which is hidden in Christ. This is also the duty of consecrated life. In this very same point of <em>Presbyterorum Ordinis</em> that priests are not less so obligated to share the truths of the Gospel of which they are ministers of. The Latin text of this document, in this place, uses the word <em>debitores</em> &#8211; debtors! The ordained priest is a debtor of the church, similar to one who has in his possession a key to a treasury, which is possessed by the whole church. What good is a house fully of gold, if no one was able to open its doors? The key to the treasury, which is the treasure of all, are possessed by the monk and particularly by the priest. If they do not share any of the treasure, they become the debtors of their neighbours as wrote St John Maria Vianney. In spirit of the charism of our order, which harkens to the tradition of the Egyptian desert hermits, the preaching of the Word of God, heard in solitude, confronted in the community of the brethren, becomes the answer to the insistent demand of those pilgriming to the hermits: &#8220;Abba, say to me a word!&#8221; </p>
