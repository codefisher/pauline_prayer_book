<p>
    Andarono in giro coperti di pelli di pecora e di capra, bisognosi, tribolati, maltrattai &mdash; di loro il mondo non era degno!  vaganti per i deserti, sui monti, tra le caverne e le spelonche della terra.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
    <sp>V/</sp> I santi che hanno sperato nel Signore,
    <br />
    <sp>R/</sp> Hanno conseguito la virtù e non avranno timore.
</p>

<h3>Midday</h3>

<p class="noindent">
    <span class="rubric">Ant.</span> The Lord crowned him with the crown of justice and bestowed on him the holy name of glory.
</p>

<reading label="Lettura Breve" ref="Wis 3:1a, 2-3"></reading>

<p>
    The souls of the virtuous are in the hands of God. In the eyes of the unwise, they did appear
    to die, their going looked like a disaster, their leaving us like annihilation; but they
    are in peace.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
    <sp>V/</sp> I put my hope in the Lord, I shall not fear.
    <br />
    <sp>R/</sp> Of whom shall I be afraid.
</p>

<h3>Afternoon</h3>

<p class="noindent">
    <span class="rubric">Ant.</span> In his struggles the Lord gave him victory, so that he might learn that godliness is more powerful than anything else.
</p>

<reading label="Lettura Breve" ref="Rom 8:35, 37"></reading>

<p>
    Nothing therefore can come between us and the love of Christ, even if we are troubled or
    worried, or being persecuted, or lacking food or clothes, or being threatened or even attacked.
    These are the trials through which we triumph, by the power of him who loved us.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
    <sp>V/</sp> Your sorrow will be turned to joy.
    <br />
    <sp>R/</sp> And your joy no one will ever take away.
</p>

<litany>God, you granted that Saint Paul, our Father,
    achieve sanctity in the desert,
    grant through his intercession,
    that we, who are striving to develop
    in ourselves a spirit of prayer and service,
    may come ever closer to you in love.
    Through Christ our Lord.
</litany>
