Prayer forms the basis of the Religious life, yet even more so, for our order, which is called to remain Alone with God Alone in prayer. It is with joy that I write this preface to this new English translation of the \textit{Modlitwenik Zakonu Paulinskiego}. As more vocations are cultivated in Australia the Province desires ever more so to authentically express the Pauline Charism among Australians.

\textit{Lex Orandi, Lex Credendi, Lex Vivendi}, as one prayers, so too does one believe and also live. Therefore, I encourage every member of our province, as well as other English speaking houses who choose to use it, to pray with this prayer book and make it apart of their way of living out our Pauline form of life. \textit{Perfectae Caritatis 6.} reminds us that: ``Drawing therefore upon the authentic sources of Christian spirituality, members of religious communities should resolutely cultivate both the spirit and practice of prayer.''  Also so do we, the Sons of St Paul of Thebes, need to draw on authentic sources of Pauline prayer in our daily lives.

The more closely we can follow Christ in prayer, the more closely can we live out the special gifts and charisms particular to our order. (Cf. Can. 577) In turn, God will bless and make ever more fruitful our mission in the Australian Church, so as to see one day the vision of Fr Augustine Lazur OSPPE flourish with the Order of St. Paul the First Hermit taking deep roots upon the land of Our Lady Help of Christians and under the Southern Cross.

\section*{Introduction to the Polish Edition}

{\setstretch{1}``Prayer is the fundamental characteristic of our spirituality. In prayer we familiarise ourselves with God's plan for ourselves and for the world, we plunge into the depths of the saving mystery of Christ and unite ourselves with the Father in the Holy Spirit renewing the face of the world.'' (The constitutions and directory of the Order of St Paul the First Hermit, no. 26, art. 26)\par}

{\setstretch{1}The Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life in the year 2002, reminded all anew, who through setting foot on the path of consecrated life, determined to give the gift of themselves to the Triune God, begin their religious call, the first enchantment with Christ, which one can never loose. In the then contemporary document of St. John Paul II, we read the following words, which allude to the thought of the saint:\par}

\begin{addmargin}[2em]{2em}
\textit{Every vocation to consecrated life is born in contemplation, from moments of intense communion and from a deep relationship of friendship with Christ, from the beauty and light which was seen shining on his face. From there the desire to always be with the Lord -- and to follow him -- matures: ``how good it is for us to be here'' (Mt 17:4).}

{\setstretch{1}Gifted with the grace of a vocation in the order of St Paul the First Hermit with greater zeal we desire each day to abide with our Master and Lord -- Jesus Christ. During prayer, let us desire to gaze into his most holy countenance, because the religious life renews itself through the unceasing contemplation of the saviour. In him we, most fully trusting in the intercession of St Paul the First Hermit and in Blessed Eusebius, go out into the world, that through our apostate we may carry the joy of the Gospel to every man.\par}


{\setstretch{1}Just as His disciples gathered in the upper room, let us abide with Mary, the Mother of the risen Lord, in prayer! Let her obtain for us all the grace of unceasing spiritual and apostolic renewal.\par}
