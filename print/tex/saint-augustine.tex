\textit{``You called us, Lord that we may search and praise you
with joy. You have created us for yourself our hearts will remain
restless until they rest in you.'' (St. Augustine, Confessions)}

O unmatchable shepherd of the Lord's flock. You are an
example for all monks and priests. May your prayers implore for us
God's clemency.
