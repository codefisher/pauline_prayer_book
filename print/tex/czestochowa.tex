\textit{``In the sixth month, the Angel Gabriel was sent by God to
a town in Galilee, called Nazareth, to a Virgin betrothed to a man
named Joseph, of the House of David; and the Virginâ€™s name was
Mary'' (Lk 1:26-27)}
\medbreak
Lord, through your will the Eternal Word became incarnate
in the womb of the Virgin Mary, grant that we who have confessed
the Saviour to be true God and True Man, may merit a participation
in His Divine Nature, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy
Spirit, one God for ever and ever. Amen.
