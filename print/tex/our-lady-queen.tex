\textit{``It is our conviction that in the course of some very turbulent history associated with our Order (of which there is no lack),
the protection of Mary has been a support in striving for holiness
and making effective our mission to those peoples to whom Divine
Providence has sent us'' (art. 60).}
\medbreak
O, Lord, our God, may the intercession of the Most Holy
Virgin Mary protect us always, that freed from all dangers, we may
rejoice in your peace. Through Christ our Lord. Amen.
