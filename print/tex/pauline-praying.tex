\textit{``Through the Word of God, the Eucharistic Sacrifice, the
Sacraments and the Liturgy of Hours, Christ continues his priestly
ministry effecting our salvation and glorifying the Father. This is
the very goal of our own ministry'' (art 20).}
\medbreak
O God our Father, you have sent your Son, the Word of
Truth, and the Spirit, the Sanctifier, to reveal to us the Mystery of
Divine life. Grant that we, who confess our true faith, may also
acknowledge the eternal glory of the Most Holy Trinity and the
unity of the Divine Persons in their power of creation, through
Christ our Lord. Amen.
