\textit{``From the very beginning our Order has enjoyed
the special assistance of Mary. She has always been present
in the life and activity of the Pauline Community. Our Order
has always honoured her as Mother, Lady and Queen and
has striven to spread (art. 60) special devotion to the
Mother of God; a devotion which expresses itself principally
in the imitation of Mary, in the action of one's personal
sanctification and in the carrying out of apostolic
works.'' (art. 3)}

Almighty God, look kindly upon the prayers your
servants offer you in honour of the Most Holy Virgin Mary,
the Mother of God, and in your mercy grant us your help.
Through Christ Our Lord. Amen.
