\chapter{Life of Prayer and Sacrifice with Christ}

\instruction{The Second Vatican Council teaches that ``the Eucharistic Sacrifice is the source and summit of the Christian life'' (LG 11) and ``\ldots the other sacraments and indeed all ecclesiastical ministries and works of the apostolate are bound up with the Eucharist and are directed towards it'' (\textit{Presbyterorum Ordinis} 5). But for us, however, the Eucharist ``becomes the power to live a life according to the Evangelical Counsels and is an effective help in bringing to reality the mission of our Monastic Community within the Church of God'' (art. 20) and ``to live the Mystery of the Cross'' (art. 34).}

\subsection{Prayer of Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament}

O Lord, Jesus Christ, in this adoration I wish to respond to your invitation: ``Watch and pray.'' Therefore, I desire to honour you, to confess my faith and love for you, truly present in this Most Holy Sacrament. You promised to remain with us to the end of time. I thank you for this promise and ask for forgiveness for my lack of love and weak faith. Strengthen and purify me by your Holy Spirit. Illumine the eyes of my mind, that I may honour you, not only with my lips, but with the holiness of my life.
\smallbreak

Jesus Christ, Son of the living God, you who are true God and true Man, I believe in your unique presence in the Most Holy Sacrament of the Eucharist and I thank you for so many blessings you have showered upon me. I adore you for your Mother, whom you have given me as my Mother and Protectress. Following her example, I desire to live in union with you, my supreme God.
\smallbreak

I salute you, O most merciful heart of my Lord, Jesus! I desire to make reparation for all the outrages committed by your enemies against your divine presence in this Sacrament. Through this act of humility and adoration, I wish to adore you in all places on earth, where you are neglected and less reverenced.
\smallbreak

O Jesus, I love you with all my heart. I am sorry that in the past I have saddened you, my infinite Goodness. I resolve with the help of your grace not to offend you anymore and now, as poor as I am, I consecrate myself totally to you. I renounce my will, my senses, my desires and everything I possess. From this moment on, direct me according to your liking. I long only for your divine love, and I pray for the grace of perseverance in this love to the end and to fulfil perfectly your Holy Will. I commend to you the poor souls in Purgatory, particularly those who had a special devotion to the Most Holy Sacrament and to the Most Blessed Virgin Mary. I commend to you, also, the unfortunate sinner.
\smallbreak

Finally, my Beloved Saviour, I join all my intentions with those of your Sacred Heart and thus joined, I offer them to your Eternal Father and I ask Him in you Holy Name to accept and graciously answer them. Amen.

\section{Preparation For Holy Mass}

\subsection{Prayer of St. Ambrose}

My kind Lord Jesus Christ, I, sinner that I am, approach the delights of your banquet in fear and trembling, not presuming on my own merits but relying upon your merciful goodness. Many a sin defiles me, body and soul; I am guilty of many an unguarded thought and word. O gracious Deity, awesome Majesty, I take refuge under your protection; I fly to you to be healed; I, a wretch caught in my oppression, appeal to you who are the very source of pity. I long for your coming, my Saviour; but if you come as Judge I cannot face you. Before you, Lord, I uncover my wounds; before you I lay bare my shame. My sins, I know, are many and grievous; they fill me with fear, but my hope is in your countless mercies.
\smallbreak

Lord Jesus Christ, eternal king, God-man crucified for man, turn your merciful gaze upon me and heed my prayer, for in you I put my trust. Have mercy upon me! I am all misery and sin, but you are an inexhaustible well of compassion. Hail, saving Victim, offered up for me and for all mankind upon the gibbet of the cross! Hail, noble and precious blood, flowing from the wounds of my crucified Lord Jesus Christ and washing away the sins of the whole world!
\smallbreak

Remember, Lord, your creature whom you have ransomed with your blood. I am sorry for my sins, and long to make amends. All-merciful Father, take away from me all my sins and iniquities, make me clean in soul and body, and give me grace to partake worthily of your Holy of Holies.
\smallbreak

Grant that this holy sacrifice of your body and blood, which I am preparing to offer up, and of which, though unworthy, I mean to partake, may accomplish the remission of my sins, wash my guilt away entirely, banish evil thoughts, revive my better impulses, incite me to perform works pleasing to you for my own good, and prove the strongest of defences, keeping me safe in body and soul from the wiles of my enemies. Amen.
\smallbreak

\subsection{Prayer of St. Thomas Aquinas}

Almighty, everlasting God, behold, I approach the sacrament of your Only-begotten Son, our Lord Jesus Christ. I come to it as a sick man to the physician who will save his life, as a man unclean to the fountain of mercy, a blind man to the radiance of eternal light, one poor and needy to the Lord of heaven and earth; praying that in your boundless generosity You will deign to cure my sickness, wash my defilement away, enlighten my blindness, enrich my poverty, and clothe my nakedness.
\smallbreak

May the Bread of Angels, the King of kings and Lord of lords, be received by me with such humble reverence and devout contrition, such faith and purity, and such good resolutions as may help the salvation of my soul. Grant me grace, I beseech You, to receive not only the sacrament of our Lord's Body and Blood, but also its inward power and effect. All-gentle God, grant that my receiving of that Body, taken from the Virgin Mary's womb by your Only-begotten Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, may fit me to become part of his Mystical Body and to be reckoned one of its members.
\smallbreak

Most loving Father, grant that your beloved Son whom I, an earthly wayfarer, am now to receive in his sacramental guise, may one day give me sight of his face and let me gaze upon Him for all eternity; who is God, living and reigning with You in the unity of the Holy Spirit for ever and ever. Amen.
\smallbreak

\subsection{Prayer to Our Lady}

O Mother of pity and loving kindness, most blessed Virgin Mary, I, a worthless and wretched sinner, fly to you in heartfelt love and confidence, entreating your compassion. You who stood by your dear Son when He hung upon the cross, have pity and deign to stand by me too, wretched sinner that I am, and by all the priests who are offering Mass this day, here and elsewhere throughout his Holy Church.
\smallbreak

By the help of your favour enable us to offer a sacrifice that shall be worthy and acceptable in the sight of the most high and undivided Trinity. Amen.

\subsection{The Priest's Declaration of Purpose before Mass}

My purpose is to celebrate Mass and to consecrate the Body and Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ according to the rite of the Holy Roman Church, to the praise of Almighty God and of the whole Church triumphant in heaven, for my own welfare and that of the whole Church militant on earth, for all who have commended themselves to my prayers.
\smallbreak

May joy and peace, amendment of life, room for true penitence, the grace and comfort of the Holy Spirit, and steadfastness in good works be granted us by the Almighty and merciful Lord. Amen.
\smallbreak

\subsection{Preface of the Holy Eucharist}

Father, all-powerful and ever-living God, we do well always and everywhere to give you thanks through Jesus Christ our Lord. At the last supper, as He sat at table with his Apostles, He offered Himself to You as the spotless Lamb, the acceptable gift that gives You perfect praise. Christ has given us this memorial of his passion to bring us its saving power until the end of time. In this great Sacrament you feed your people and strengthen them in holiness, so that the family of mankind may come to walk in the light of one faith, in one communion of love. Amen.

God, who has conferred upon us a royal priesthood, we pray to you give us grace to minister at your holy altar with hearts as clean and lives as blameless as that of blessed Joseph, who was found worthy to hold in his arms and, with all reverence, to carry You the only-begotten Son, born of the Virgin Mary. Enable us this day to receive worthily the sacred Body and Blood of your Son, and enable us to win an everlasting reward in the world to come; through the same Christ our Lord. Amen.

Lord, I believe in You; oh, give me a firmer faith. I hope in You, give me a surer hope. I love You, make me love you more and more. I am sorry to have failed You; make me sorrier yet.
\smallbreak

I adore You as my first beginning, and long for You as my last end; I praise You as my constant benefactor, and call upon You as my gracious protector:
\smallbreak

Guide me by your wisdom, restrain me by your justice, comfort me by your mercy, defend me by your power.
\smallbreak

I offer You, Lord, my thoughts, to be fixed on You; my words, to have You for their theme; my actions, to be done according to your will; my hardships, to be endured for your sake.
\smallbreak

My will is that your will be done, in the manner You will, and as long as You will, because it is your will.
\smallbreak

I pray You, Lord, enlighten my understanding, inflame my will, purify my heart, and sanctify my soul.
\smallbreak

Help me to deplore my past offences and to resist temptations in the future, to subdue my evil inclinations and to cultivate the virtues proper to my state. God of all goodness, fill me with love of You and hatred of myself, with zeal for my neighbour and contempt of worldly things.
\smallbreak

Teach me to be obedient to my superiors, helpful to my subordinates, faithful to friends, forgiving to foes.

Let me vanquish pleasure by self-denial, avarice by generosity, anger by meekness, and lukewarmness by fervour.

Make me prudent in planning, courageous in taking risks; in affliction, patient; in prosperity, unassuming.

Lord, make me attentive at prayers, moderate when I eat and drink, diligent in my occupation, and constant in good resolutions.

Let my conscience be clear, my demeanour modest, my talk blameless, my life well-ordered. Let me always be alert to keep nature in check, to cherish your grace, to keep your law, and to act in a manner befitting salvation.

My God, grant me eloquence, full of gentleness and wisdom that would not arouse me with an arrogance and superiority over others. I beg You to implant in my mouth the words of consolation, inducement and encouragement. May I, through the power of the Holy Spirit inspire the good to be better, convert the wayward and, through my words and example, direct them on the path of righteousness. May the words You give to your servant be as it were, like sharp fiery arrows that would penetrate and enkindle the souls of the listeners to a holy fear and love of You. Amen.

God the Holy Spirit, ignite our hearts and souls with the fire of your love that we may all serve You in submission and fidelity to your Word.

\subsection{Prayer of the Confessor before administering the Sacrament of Reconciliation}

God, Father of mercy, giver of all gifts and charisms, confer upon me the gift of your wisdom, responsibility and unique discretion to know the spiritual needs of the penitents that I may, as their confessor, help them in their process of conversion of life. Grant me the grace to discern accurately the true state of their consciences, that I may form them in truth and in the spirit of the Gospel.
\smallbreak

God, Father of compassion, give me the grace to be always a helpful servant to penitents, in their difficult process of conversion; to lift them up from an even worse downfall. Give me the grace to sincerely sympathise with them over their offence to God and ignorance of His love. As a minister of your mysteries, may I communicate your merciful love that leads man, overburdened with guilt, to reconciliation with You and with the Church, which, through the sins of the faithful, sustains many wounds and injustices.
\smallbreak

Lord, Jesus Christ You came into the word to seek out and save those who were lost, to call to repentance the sinner, to heal the broken-hearted. You desire not the death of the sinner, and await his conversion. Give me the grace to know for certain, that your love is stronger and greater than all our sins. May my intention to administer this sacrament be always pure and clear, that God may be honoured in everything and penitents be sanctified, spiritually liberated and healed. May my priestly zeal be prudent, my love pure and selfless, because I am administering this sacrament in Your Name, in Your substitution, when I become somehow one with You, Jesus Christ, the Eternal Priest. Lord Jesus Christ, grant me the grace to be fully aware of your presence and your saving work. Make me merciful, kind and wise in asking questions, in carrying the pastoral dialogues, cautious and foreseeing in giving spiritual advice, in imposing the sacramental penance, in encouraging and strengthening the realisation of ones vocation in life.
\smallbreak

O Lord, You have sent the Holy Spirit to your Apostles to forgive sins and through the breath of this same Holy Spirit You have bestowed the power to loose and to bind. May this Holy Spirit, through his power, make my ministry successful and fruitful. Be with me, O Holy Spirit, especially in difficult situations and cases, that in showing understanding and compassion to penitents, I may never depart from the sound teaching of the Church.
\smallbreak

Strengthen me O Lord, one God in the unity of the Most Holy Trinity, with your spiritual strength, that in helping others, I myself may not be rejected.\\ Mother of Mercy, pray for us!
\smallbreak

\subsection{Prayer of the Confessor after administering the Sacrament of Reconciliation}

O Lord Jesus Christ, our Redeemer and Conqueror of sin, I thank You that You have become the sacrifice of forgiveness for our sins and the sins of the whole world. In your wounds, lay our healing! You did not spare your Precious Blood to deliver us from the misery of our sins. Give me, and all my penitents, the grace to participate fully in your victory over sin that we may die to sin that thus it may never rule over us; and that we may live in your grace and grow in newness of life. I entrust to your infinite mercy, all my penitents that they may keep their good resolutions, on the road of new life. Surround with your merciful love especially those who for some reason, did not receive the sacrament of absolution, that they may not carry grudges against anybody, but come to You in due time, according to your holy will.
\smallbreak

O Lord of clemency, through your all powerful grace, make up for all my deficiencies, limitations, human weaknesses, errors, unawareness and shortcomings, committed while administering the sacrament of mercy. Be merciful to me!
\smallbreak

O Lord Jesus Christ, always rich in your mercy, You change the unjust into just, to the depressed You offer the hope and joy of new life. Grant us the grace, we pray, that we may never waste the gifts received from You. As we, ourselves experience your merciful love, may we, too, be witnesses of this love toward others. \\ Mary, Refuge of sinners, pray for us!

O Lord, our Almighty God, You are the source of light and wisdom, pour into my will, my memory and all my faculties the grace of your blessing.

Shed your light at the beginning of my study, direct its progress and bring it to a fulfilling outcome. For You live and reign for ever and ever. Amen.

\subsection{Prayer for the sanctification of labour}

St. Joseph, the example of all working people, pray for me, that I may work in a spirit of penance, to satisfy for my numerous sins; that I may work conscientiously, not for my personal glorification, but as the fulfilment of my duty and obligation; that I may work with a joyous and happy heart for the privilege to use and develop the talents received from God; that I may keep an order, quietness, moderation and patience in my work without submission to weariness and hardships; above all that I have a good intention and, forgetting myself, keep always before my eyes my death and the account I must render for lost time and wasted gifts, for the omission to do good, for vanity in my success, so displeasing in the eyes of God.

All for You, my Lord, Jesus! All through Mary, my mother. All in your likeness and with your help, O St. Joseph! May this be the watchword in my life and death. Amen

\textit{``\ldots but the Jews shouted still louder to crucify him\ldots so in the end Pilate handed him over to them to be crucified \ldots ''}
\smallbreak

Every road of religious life begins with the first station of the cross. The decision to abandon the world, and to petition for admission at the Monastery door has passed. Was I fully aware that, like Christ, I was entering the road of the cross; truly a pilgrimage of the cross? Was I mindful of the truth that the sweetness of mystic experience will dawn upon me, only after the night of affliction?
\smallbreak

O most holy Will of God, may I seek only you and may the fulfilment of your Will be my greatest delight. Lord Jesus, may you be for my soul as a true vine to its branches.
\smallbreak

\subsubsection*{The Second Station \\ {\small\normalfont Jesus accepts his cross}}

\prayer{L.}{\textbf{We adore You, O Christ, and we praise You!}}
\prayer{All}{Because by your Holy Cross, You have redeemed the world.}
\smallbreak

Jesus began the road of his suffering in the Garden of Gethsemane. Later, the nocturnal interrogations, the crowning with thorns, the scourging, exhausted him, even before his passion.
\smallbreak

On the day of my admission I felt very energetic and enthusiastic, ready to begin a new adventure, a new state of life. Because of my weakness, God, in His wisdom, did not allow me to foresee the heavy weight of the religious and priestly life. He did not want me to be disheartened before I had learned to depend on His grace alone.
\smallbreak

O Jesus, teach me to hold your image with the cross in my hands and in my heart, that I may have the wisdom to understand these words: ``Once having made the choice, I have to choose anew constantly.'' Teach me to remember the glorious message of Easter.
\smallbreak

\subsubsection*{The Third Station \\ {\small\normalfont Jesus falls the first time}}

\prayer{L.}{\textbf{We adore You, O Christ, and we praise You!}}
\prayer{All}{Because by your Holy Cross, You have redeemed the world.}
\smallbreak

Jesus, because of the weight of the cross, and the noise of the pushing crowd, you begin to feel weak, unstable and shaky. You begin to stumble on the stony road and all of a sudden you fall to the ground.
\smallbreak

This can happen to me too, especially at the beginning of my religious formation. I discover in myself more and more areas that are totally alienated from the ideals of Holy Scripture, of my religious rules and of the ascetical writings which I am reading. These ideals contrast with my real human weakness. Then, I ask myself: ``Is this the right place for me?''
\smallbreak

O Lord, be my strength when I become discouraged. I cannot depart from you. I will arise again and go on. Once again, I will look at my Brothers and discover in them a hidden greatness.
\smallbreak

\subsubsection*{The Fourth Station \\ {\small\normalfont Jesus meets his sorrowful Mother}}

\prayer{L.}{\textbf{We adore You, O Christ, and we praise You!}}
\prayer{All}{Because by your Holy Cross, You have redeemed the world.}
\smallbreak

For a short time, the eyes of Jesus and Mary, his Mother, met in a sorrow beyond description. It was just a brief moment and yet it contained everything: their love, their pain, their determination and their obedience to the Will of the Eternal Father.
\smallbreak

It is a common conviction, that the decision to choose the consecrated religious life, is born in the heart of the Mother of God. Every good inspiration comes to us from heaven through the mediation of Mary, as an answer to her request: ``they have no wine'' (Jn 2:4). This is very true in every vocation to the Pauline Order.
\smallbreak

O Queen of Czestochowa! I am with you, I remember, and am vigilant to cherish the love of Jesus for me, the love that you have given me. May this love and devotion to your sweet name reign in my heart and engage all my emotions.
\smallbreak

\subsubsection*{The Fifth Station \\ {\small\normalfont Simon of Cyrene helps Jesus to carry his cross}}

\prayer{L.}{\textbf{We adore You, O Christ, and we praise You!}}
\prayer{All}{Because by your Holy Cross, You have redeemed the world.}
\smallbreak

Simon, probably forced to carry the cross, did not realise whom he was helping, the important thing was he actually helped. A kind-hearted person would respond in the same way.
\smallbreak

In the time of distress, God does not leave us alone, but sends us a friend with encouragement. In the case of religious community life, it may be a spiritual director, a confessor, a superior or a brother. Through them, our heavenly Father watches over us and supports us in the time of our inner needs.
\smallbreak

May we always have the courage and strength to ask for, or accept, the help offered to us by other people, but always arranged by Divine Providence!
\smallbreak

\subsubsection*{The Sixth Station \\ {\small\normalfont Veronica wipes the Face of Jesus}}

\prayer{L.}{\textbf{We adore You, O Christ, and we praise You!}}
\prayer{All}{Because by your Holy Cross, You have redeemed the world.}
\smallbreak

Out of great compassion, a courageous woman, by the name of Veronica wipes the bloody, sweaty face of her beloved Master on his way to Calvary. O St. Veronica you have done what I would do when I look on the afflicted face of my beloved Redeemer.
\smallbreak

Often, we see in our Monasteries persons, weighed down with keen, personal suffering of sickness or age. There is a need for great souls, filled with goodness, who would hasten with help and bring them solace and comfort. Sometimes, just a little kindness, a smile, a good word and above all a prayer, can change unexpectedly sadness into joy.
\smallbreak

O Jesus Christ, teach me to dry the tears, not only of my brothers in religious life, but also those that stream down the faces of my brothers and sisters in the confessional and at the Monastery door.
\smallbreak

\subsubsection*{The Seventh Station \\ {\small\normalfont Jesus falls the second time We adore you, O Christ, and we bless you!}}

\prayer{L.}{\textbf{We adore You, O Christ, and we praise You!}}
\prayer{All}{Because by your Holy Cross, You have redeemed the world.}
\smallbreak

What caused Jesus to fall again? Certainly not the cross, Simon of Cyrene carried it. Yes, yet Jesus noticed an evil desire in my soul beginning to take root. That is the real reason for the Saviour's fall.
\smallbreak

Jesus cautions me with the words, once addressed to St. Peter: ``\ldots Simon, Simon, the devil has demanded your soul \ldots '' I ask and then answer with St. Paul the Apostle: ``I am a miserable man! Who will deliver me from death of the flesh? The grace of God, through Jesus Christ \ldots ''
\smallbreak

O Lord, defend me from Satan's trap and from the frailty of my will.
\smallbreak

\subsubsection*{The Eighth Station \\ {\small\normalfont Jesus consoles the women of Jerusalem}}

\prayer{L.}{\textbf{We adore You, O Christ, and we praise You!}}
\prayer{All}{Because by your Holy Cross, You have redeemed the world.}
\smallbreak

``Daughters of Jerusalem do not weep for me, but for your children.'' Often, the world feels sorry for those who have left it, in order to serve God and his people exclusively. In its eyes, they seem to be foolish and naïve for not developing and using wisely their talents and for embracing all types of inconveniences \ldots but it is a false, pagan sympathy. Behold our Lord and God who teaches us in the light of eternity by saying: Come, you blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom, prepared for you from the very foundation of the world.''
\smallbreak

O Jesus, teach me to guard and increase the grace of my monastic, hermitical and apostolic vocation to live for God in solitude: ``Alone with God, alone.''
\smallbreak

\subsubsection*{The Ninth Station \\ {\small\normalfont Jesus falls the third time}}

\prayer{L.}{\textbf{We adore You, O Christ, and we praise You!}}
\prayer{All}{Because by your Holy Cross, You have redeemed the world.}
\smallbreak

A great loss of physical strength caused Jesus to collapse again, shortly before he arrived at Calvary hill. Before his public mission, Jesus was tempted by the devil upon another hill. O Lord, it was not the devil who struck you down. It was me. Through my arrogance and pride, I pushed and knocked you over, I, a man particularly consecrate to you. The pleasure of passion has begotten a sin and sin brought forth death.
\smallbreak

O Holy Spirit, give me the gift of prudence and courage that I may always resist the lustful thoughts and actions that tarnish purity of heart. O Immaculate Virgin Mary, my Mother, cover me with your mantle of purity and innocence and help me to keep my vow of chastity untainted.
\smallbreak

\subsubsection*{The Tenth Station \\ {\small\normalfont Jesus is stripped of his garments}}

\prayer{L.}{\textbf{We adore You, O Christ, and we praise You!}}
\prayer{All}{Because by your Holy Cross, You have redeemed the world.}
\smallbreak

The world in its immoderate appetite for sensuality, goes so far as it dares to disrobe even God-Man himself of his divine and human dignity. May the darkness of which the Gospels speak, envelop the hill of Golgotha and cover the humiliated Lord, exposed to the jeer of the crowd. Every person, even the consecrated, may strip himself of sanctifying grace, by breaking the virtues and the vows of chastity, poverty and obedience. Through a grievous infidelity to the religious consecration, a Father or a Brother exposes himself to a most humiliating darkness.
\smallbreak

O Jesus, my Lord! May I never depart from your Holy Will, because of the lack of vigilance on my part. May the sign of my habit, constantly remind me of my consecration and may it strengthen the faith of the people I serve.
\smallbreak

\subsubsection*{The Eleventh Station \\ {\small\normalfont Jesus is nailed to the Cross}}

\prayer{L.}{\textbf{We adore You, O Christ, and we praise You!}}
\prayer{All}{Because by your Holy Cross, You have redeemed the world.}
\smallbreak

``When they arrived at Golgotha, they crucified him there.'' Jesus himself stretched out his arms and feet for the nailing. This was his decision to obey his Father in everything.
\smallbreak

O Jesus, my Lord! For you I have left my family and friends; for you, I have disowned my property; for you, I have given up the right to exercise my personal freedom; for you, I have decided to follow the evangelical counsels, the constitutions and directory of my Pauline Order. This is my cross! This is my inadequate imitation of you!
\smallbreak

``O Lord Jesus! to you, I want to offer everything, and for you, I desire to live and die.'' Defend me, O Lord Jesus from the temptation to come down from the cross of my religious vows, pronounced in the Order of St. Paul the First Hermit.
\smallbreak

\subsubsection*{The Twelfth Station \\ {\small\normalfont Jesus dies on the Cross}}

\prayer{L.}{\textbf{We adore You, O Christ, and we praise You!}}
\prayer{All}{Because by your Holy Cross, You have redeemed the world.}
\smallbreak

When we were still in the slavery of sin, Jesus delivered himself for our sake to death, a death on the cross. St John, the beloved Apostle, testified to this love when he wrote: ``Those who were his own, he loved them to the end.''
\smallbreak

The Crucified Lord awaits my self-denial in the monastic community life. He expects my share in his bitter passion and crucifixion. The Lord allowed his Sacred Heart to be pierced to show me the height and depth, the length and breadth of his love for me. His Heart was opened wide to be my refuge and my hiding place, whenever I feel ashamed because of my shortcomings and even serious failures.
\smallbreak

O Lord Jesus, I confess my weakness. I know that without you, I can do nothing. Inflame my soul with the fire of your love that I may love you above all things and my brothers for your sake, remembering the words of St. Paul, the Apostle'' ``\ldots but without love, nothing can help me\ldots '' (2Cor 13: 1-13).
\smallbreak

\subsubsection*{The Thirteenth Station \\ {\small\normalfont Jesus is taken down from the Cross}}

\prayer{L.}{\textbf{We adore You, O Christ, and we praise You!}}
\prayer{All}{Because by your Holy Cross, You have redeemed the world.}
\smallbreak

Mary, the Mother of all Sorrows, holds the dead body of her Son. With a broken heart, she cries out: ``All of you, who pass by, see if there is any sorrow like my sorrow?''
\smallbreak

I earnestly desire, O Mother of all Sorrows, to place the moment of my death into your hands. At the foot of the cross, your dying Son has entrusted me to you, and you to me. Now, I have a right to ask you to be with me at the hour of my death.
\smallbreak

O my sweet Jesus, I will be eternally grateful to you in heaven, that when on earth, I have followed your way, the simplest and the shortest, through Mary, our Mother. Give me the grace to obey always the request of you Mother: ``Do whatever he tells you'' (Jn 2:5).
\smallbreak

\subsubsection*{The Fourteenth Station \\ {\small\normalfont Jesus is buried in the tomb}}

\prayer{L.}{\textbf{We adore You, O Christ, and we praise You!}}
\prayer{All}{Because by your Holy Cross, You have redeemed the world.}
\smallbreak

The body of our beloved Redeemer, wrapped in the shroud, lies in peace in the niche hewn in the rock.
\smallbreak

There, will the last station of my earthly pilgrimage be. Clothed in my white habit, with the Rosary at my side, and with the cross in my hands, my mortal body will be laid out in a humble, wooden coffin, but my Brothers will pray for my immortal soul: ``Eternal rest grant unto him, O Lord, and let perpetual light shine upon him. May he rest in peace!'' My mortal body will be laid to rest among my Brothers, awaiting the glorious resurrection.
\smallbreak

O, my beloved Saviour, even now I thank you for the grace of religious life, for the fraternal charity, prayers and care of my Brothers. Be merciful to me on the day of my judgement!
\smallbreak

\subsection{I will remain under the Cross}

I will remain under your Cross, my Lord and Redeemer, when people praise me. I will recall your humiliation, that my vanity may be humiliated.
\smallbreak

I will remain under your Cross, my Lord and Redeemer, when people reproach me.
\smallbreak

I will recall your silence, that my lips may be sealed.
\smallbreak

I will remain under your Cross, my Lord and Redeemer, when people will persecute me. I will remember the scourging of your sacred Body, that my self-love may be abased.
\smallbreak

I will remain under your Cross, my Lord and Redeemer, when I will suffer shortage of necessities, and I will remember your poverty. Teach me to rejoice in my material and spiritual deficiencies
\smallbreak

I will remain under your Cross, my Lord and Redeemer, when evil thoughts disturb my mind. I will remember your crowning with thorns, that my thoughts may be calm and collected.
\smallbreak

I will remain under your Cross, my Lord and Redeemer, when evil passions storm my heart. I will be mindful of your bruised body, that I may overcome the temptation of the flesh.
\smallbreak

I will remain under your Cross, my Lord and Redeemer, when people judge me unjustly. I will pray for them: ``Our Father, forgive them.'' Teach me to forgive always.
\smallbreak

I will remain under your Cross, my Lord and Redeemer, when my conscience accuses me and leads me to desperation. I will recall your words spoken to the thief: ``Today you will be with me in paradise.''
\smallbreak

I will remain under your Cross, my Lord and Redeemer, when the world and people reject me. I will remember the words, addressed to your Mother: ``Woman behold your son.'' She will console me.
\smallbreak

I will remain under your Cross, my Lord and Redeemer, when the darkness overshadows my soul. Your cross will give me light. When my strength begins to fail, your cross will fortify me. When my life path starts to deviate, your cross will show me the way.
\smallbreak

I will remain under your Cross, my Lord and Redeemer, when people will not welcome me into their homes and hearts. Then, I will place my head and heart on the wood of your cross.
\smallbreak

My Lord and Redeemer, always and everywhere I want to live and die under your cross.
\smallbreak

Under your cross, I wish to shed my bitter tears for my sins. On your cross, you have wrought the salvation of the human race. Under your cross, I also desire to work and shed tears for my salvation.
\smallbreak

\subsection[Prayer to Jesus Christ]{Prayer to Jesus Christ \\ {\small\normalfont (St. Augustine)}}

O Lord Jesus, give me the grace to know you and to know myself, that I may desire nothing except you, that I may not overestimate myself but to love you, that I may act only for you.
\smallbreak

Help me to humble myself and to exalt you, to think of nothing else, but you; to die to myself, and live only for you. I want to accept everything from your hands.
\smallbreak

I want to mortify my senses that I may follow you and walk in your footsteps, all the days of my life.
\smallbreak

May I turn away from myself and turn to you alone.
\smallbreak

Lord, be my defender always! May I be distrustful of myself and filled with filial fear of you.
\smallbreak

May I be worthy to be numbered among your chosen friends.
\smallbreak

May I never trust myself, but place all my confidence in you.
\smallbreak

May nothing attract me, but only you!
\smallbreak

Look upon me, that I may love you.
\smallbreak

Call me and I will come to see your face and forever savour your sweetness. Amen.
\smallbreak

\subsection{Various Prayers}

My good and dearest Jesus, lo, I kneel before you beseeching and praying to you with all the ardour of my soul to engrave deep and vivid impressions of faith, hope, and charity upon my heart, with true repentance for my sins, and a very firm resolve to make amends. Meanwhile I ponder over your five wounds, dwelling on them with deep compassion and grief, and recalling the words that the prophet David wrote long ago, good Jesus, concerning yourself: They have pierced my hands and my feet; they have counted all my bones!
\smallbreak
\par \hrulefill\smallbreak

O Lord Jesus Christ, may your passion strengthen, protect and defend me. May your Wounds be my food and drink, which refresh me, inebriate me and fill me with joy. May the sprinkling of your Blood, wash me from all my sins. May your death be for me a source of inexhaustible life. May your Cross be my eternal glory. In all of this, may I find strengthening, joy, health and sweetness of heart. For you live and reign for ever and ever. Amen
\smallbreak
\par \hrulefill\smallbreak

O, Lord God, we pray, give the grace of perfect love to your servant. Through the merits of your passion, death and resurrection, through the intercession of the Mother of God, ever Virgin, preserve us, our loved ones, our families and benefactors and our home in the grace of sanctity. Dispel from us all evil.
\smallbreak

Never allow us to be overcome by temptation and rescue us from all dangers. Watch over the Church, our Order, our nation, our parents, friends and all who are in need of your mercy.
\smallbreak

Guard our Holy Father, all bishops of the world and especially our Father General. To all the faithful departed, grant eternal peace in your Kingdom. May we all praise you in heaven with your Son and our Lord, Jesus Christ, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. Amen.
\smallbreak
\par \hrulefill\smallbreak

O, Lord Jesus Christ, Master of my life! Remove from me the spirit of laziness, depression and empty talkativeness. Grant to your servant a spirit of joy, peace, patience and love. Lord, allow me to see my sins and never judge my Brother. For you are blessed, for ever and ever. Amen.

\subsubsection[Prayer for humility]{Prayer for humility \\ {\small\normalfont (composed by Mother Teresa of Calcutta)}}

O, Jesus, your heart was filled with silence and humility. I humbly bow before you with a true sorrow as I recognise the devastation caused by the pride of my heart.
\smallbreak

Lord, in your infinite mercy, give me the grace that I would not speak much about myself, but about your Gospel message, that I may not give in to curiosity and not overburden others with my problems or try to control their lives.
\smallbreak

Lord, Jesus, I am sorry if I ever have yielded to the temptation of sadness and self-pity, doubt or discouragement. I desire to accept with joy and even with humour all the contradictions of life, which I have to face day by day. I cannot pay much attention to the mistakes of others, but have to remember the fact that we are all weak.
\smallbreak

O, Jesus Christ, my Lord! You did not respond or defend yourself when you were falsely accused. Give me the ability to welcome bitter remarks, unjust and unfair accusations, offences and even insults, as if they were veritable pearls. May my will be free from personal, selfish stubbornness, and be willing to fulfil the wishes of others.
\smallbreak

In the past, I have been accepting of the praises of others and enjoyed being seen and acknowledged. O, my Master, help me from now on to see the light of holiness, often hidden in the shadow of humility and to cherish those moments of my life, marked with insolence, neglect, ignorance or ingratitude.
\smallbreak

O, my Lord! Up to now I have been kind towards people who love and respect me. Free me of this weakness and make me well-disposed toward all with kindness, meekness and generosity, especially towards those who are less lovable and ungrateful.
\smallbreak

O, Holy Spirit of truth and love! You imprint the image of Jesus in our souls. Bestow upon me the grace to fall in love with the modesty of my Saviour, Jesus Christ. He did not try to please the people with his glory or to impress them with his majesty and power. He took upon himself our human nature, which we have wounded by sin.
\smallbreak

I humbly ask you, inspire me with the longing to avoid everything that would inspire people to value me, to love me, to admire me or to follow me, because of my personality or achievements. May everything I do and talk about, inspire others to love more and more the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the Immaculate Heart of Mary.
\smallbreak

O Divine Master! You are the true friend of sinners, of tax-collectors, of abandoned and forgotten children, of lonely strangers, of broken hearts, and of all whose lives may be compared to a dimming lamp or a swaying reed.
\smallbreak

O, Divine Master! You hide your divine majesty under the veil of the suffering face of the Man of Sorrows! May I never abuse my human dignity or personal authority, to justify my decisions or actions. Instead, may I offer everything for your glory!
\smallbreak

For you live and reign for ever and ever. Amen.

\instruction{From among the fifteen mysteries of the Holy Rosary, only two are not mentioned in the Holy Scriptures. This is a reason why Pope Pius XII called the Rosary ``a summary of the Gospel.'' This is confirmed also by our Constitution: ``Our devotion to the Most Holy Virgin is based on the Gospels and teaching of the Church'' (Art 61)}

\subsubsection*{The first joyful mystery \\ {\small\normalfont The Annunciation:}}

``In the sixth month, the Angel Gabriel was sent by God to a town in Galilee called Nazareth, to a Virgin, whose name was Mary. The Angel said to her: `Rejoice, so highly favoured\ldots You are to conceive and bear a Son, and you will name him Jesus' '' (Lk 1:26-31)
\smallbreak

\subsubsection*{The second joyful mystery \\ {\small\normalfont The Visitation:}}

``Mary set out at that time and went as quickly as she could to a town in the hill country of Judah\ldots Now as soon as Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting\ldots she gave a loud cry and said, `Of all women you are the most blessed, and blessed is the fruit of your womb' '' (Lk 1:39-42).
\smallbreak

\subsubsection*{The third joyful mystery \\ {\small\normalfont The Nativity:}}

``While they were there the time came for her to have her Child, and she gave birth to a Son, her first-born. She wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them at the inn'' (Lk 2: 2-7)
\smallbreak

\subsubsection*{The fourth joyful mystery \\ {\small\normalfont The Presentation:}}

``And when the day came for them to be purified as laid down by the Law of Moses, they took him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord\ldots and also offered in sacrifice\ldots a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons'' (Lk 2: 22-24)
\smallbreak

The Pauline tradition and the faith teach us, that the liturgy and the prayer is a work of the whole Church; both of the pilgrim Church on earth and of the glorious one in heaven.

Holy choirs of Angels! You were the first from among all creatures to recognize the supreme authority of God over you, paid him homage and adorned him; teach us to humble ourselves before God's majesty.
\smallbreak

Holy servants of the Lord! You always stand before the throne of God, ready to obey his commands; teach us to remain faithful in fulfilling God's holy will.
\smallbreak

St. Michael the Archangel, prince of the heavenly hosts, who with a cry ``Who's like God'' defeated Lucifer and his angels; inspire us with a zeal to work for the greater glory of God.
\smallbreak

St. Gabriel the Archangel, who announced to the Holy Virgin Mary that she would become Mother of the Son of God by the power of the Holy Spirit; illuminate our minds, that like Mary, we may accept all revealed truths of God with a deep humility.
\smallbreak

St. Raphael the Archangel, who happily guided Tobiah and protected him against an evil spirit; be our companion on our earthly pilgrimage to the heavenly homeland.
\smallbreak

Holy Angels, who unceasingly contemplate the face of the heavenly Father; teach us to see God and his perfection everywhere.
\smallbreak

Holy Angels, who sang the glory of God and announced his peace to the people of good will at the birth of Jesus; bring peace of Christ to our hearts.
\smallbreak

Holy Angels, in whose company, Christ will come to judge the living and the dead; lead us on the way to salvation.
\smallbreak

Holy Angels, who stand before the throne of God; present to him our prayers and deeds, that he may kindly accept them, forgive all our sins and grant us the grace to join you in heaven forever and ever. Amen.

\chapter{Contemplation of God in His Saints}

\instruction{The Second Vatican Council reminds us that in honouring the saints, the Church proclaims the paschal mystery. The Church presents their exemplary lives that steer us on our way to the Eternal Father and allow us to participate in their abundant merits (cf SL 104). In our Constitutions we read the following: ``We are led to do this through the example of St. Paul the First Hermit in his communing one-on-one with God \ldots We are further encouraged by the tradition of our Fathers, but above all, through the example of the praying Christ and his Mother. It is in prayer that we are able to recognize the plan of God for us and for the world'' (art. 26).}
\smallbreak

\instruction{In our Order, we honour particularly St. Joseph, St. Paul the First Hermit, St. Augustine, St. Casimir, St. Hedwig. We follow the virtues of our Founder, Blessed Eusebius. Their examples of holiness inspire us in our yearning for Christian perfection.}

\newpageheader{Contemplation of God in His Saints}{Saint Joseph}

\section{Saint Joseph}

\instruction{St. Joseph was a righteous man, to whom the divine Providence has entrusted the privilege to participate decisively in the greatest mysteries of salvation. It was he who obeyed the command of the Angel and took Mary into his house as his wife. He believed that she had truly conceived the Divine Child through the power of the Holy Spirit (cf Mt. 1:19-25). When mortal danger for the Child from King Herod arrived, ``so Joseph got up and taking the Child and his Mother with him, left that night for Egypt'' (Mt 2:14). When the danger passed, he ``returned to the land of Israel, and settled in the town of Nazareth in Galilee. In this way the words spoken through the prophets were to be fulfilled `He will be called a Nazarene' ``(Mt. 2:23). When Jesus began his public mission, St. Joseph appeared at the Jordan River, where he was baptized by St. John. Jesus was thought to be the son of Joseph (cf. Lk 3:23). In the Church's liturgy and in the piety of the believes, St. Joseph stands as a man of justice, a most faithful servant of the living God, Spouse of the Most Holy Virgin Mary and a silent witness of divine mysteries. ``He stands on the threshold of Old and New Testaments. In his person, the dignity of Patriarchs and the oracles of the Prophets, find their fulfilment'' (St. Bernardino of Siena). The cult to St. Joseph, in the Pauline tradition does not exceed specifically the general veneration, due to St. Joseph and practiced in the Catholic Church.}

O St. Joseph, we flee to your protection in all our necessities. Having invoked the help of your Holy Spouse Mary, we also ask for your aid.

O providential Guardian of the Holy Family, watch constantly over the posterity of Jesus Christ. Remove from us, our beloved Father, all error and corruption. Come to the rescue of our struggles with the powers of darkness. As once you saved the Child Jesus from the danger that imperilled his life, so today defend the Church of God from all adversities and snares of the devil. Surround us with your constant protection, that following your example, and strengthened with your help, we may live piously, die happily and obtain everlasting happiness in heaven. Amen.

\includeimage{saint-paul-crown.pdf}\input{tex/saint-paul-crown}\newpageheader{Contemplation of God in His Saints}{Saint Paul the First Hermit}

\section{St. Paul the First Hermit}

\instruction{In the light of the recent studies, St. Paul the First Hermit lived in the years between 228 -341. His personality and life style harmonizes perfectly with the events and situation of the Church of the first centuries. The exact dates are not of great importance but the example, as an ideal model of the hermit and his personal union with God, remains always a great and worthy attraction for Christians to follow.}
\smallbreak

\instruction{St. Paul the First Hermit is well known among the early Fathers of the Church and in the lives of the first anchorites. Down the centuries in Pauline Communities, the title ``St. Paul the First Hermit'' was generally accepted and approved by the Holy See as an official name of the Order.}
\smallbreak

\instruction{It was St. Jerome that wrote the life of St. Paul the First Hermit. According to his relations, St. Paul was a quite educated man in Greek and Egyptian culture. He was endowed with a noble and gentle nature towards the people. During the persecution of the Church, inspired by the Holy Spirit, he left the family home and settled himself in the desert, where ``alone with God alone'', he spent all his earthy life in prayer and contemplation of God's mysteries.}
\smallbreak

\instruction{There is no any doubt that St. Paul the First Hermit was a historical figure. However, many extraordinary stories, related by St. Jerome (345-420), are not necessarily true or essential. For all Pauline generations, St. Paul the First Hermit is not only the most venerable and beloved Patriarch of their Order, but above all a living symbol of imitation of Christ in the desert that originated in the past, but still flourishes today and will continue to inspire his spiritual sons for generations to come.}

\subsection{Novena to St. Paul the First Hermit}

\instruction{Traditionally, we begin the Novena 9 days before the external solemnity of St. Paul the First Hermit. It is before the next Sunday after the 15th of January. The novena to St. Paul the First Hermit enjoys a special splendour. It should take place in the chapel or at another place, dedicated to St. Paul the First Hermit. All members of the community take part in the Novena. The solemnly professed Monks wear the processional mantle. After the solemn entrance to the place of devotion and the placing of the relics of our Patriarch, one of the hymns honouring St. Paul the First Hermit is sung. The faithful are encouraged to join the singing, alternately. It is favourable to sing the hymns with an accompanying music, either organ or trumpet orchestra. A short homily should be delivered at the end of the devotion. The veneration of the relics takes place, followed by the blessing with the reliquary given to the participants according to the Order ritual.}

\section{Blessed Eusebius}

\instruction{Blessed Eusebius is considered a confounder of the Order of the Brothers of St. Paul the First Hermit. Of his initiatives the Pauline Order began to exist in Hungary in 1250. It was created of the two joined monasteries of hermits living along the Danube River forests: the Monastery of St. Jacob, situated upon the hill of Patacs and the Monastery of the Holy Cross. Blessed Eusebius, a Canon of Esztergom (lat. Strigonium) during the invasion of Turks in 1241, running for his life, found a safety in the forests of Pecs, where he encountered many saintly men living individually in seclusion. In 1246 he gathered them together in the Monastery of the Holy Cross. By doing this, he laid the foundation for the religious community that lived under the rule of Bishop Bartholomew. Practically, he was the first provincial of the new Order which since 1250 has accepted a title: ``Order of the Brothers of St. Paul the First Hermit.'' In 1263 at the first General Chapter this title was approved, and in 1308 sanctioned by the Pope Clement V and conveyed to them by Cardinal Gentilis. Because of his efforts to establish and gain approval from the Holy See of a new religious community and his saintly life, Eusebius, has enjoyed great popularity among the people since his death in 1270. They venerated him like a church canonized Saint. His labours produced many blessed fruits of holiness of many members of the Order he founded. In popular devotion, he is invoked as the ``Blessed.''}

\section{Saint Augustine}

\instruction{St. Augustine (354-430), bishop of Hippo, Doctor of the Church is the Father and Legislator of our Order. As the result of his deep conversion in 385 after a dissolute life style, he was baptized by St. Ambrose at age 33 and admitted to the Catholic Church on December 8th. Shortly after, he resigned from the post as the teacher of rhetoric, sold his inheritance, and started a monastic life, which he organized in Tagaste (North Africa) in 391. The same year, he was ordained a priest and dedicated himself to the studies of Scriptures. In 396 he was consecrated Bishop of Hippo. In his pastoral administration, St. Augustine cared for the clergy and monastic life. He combated Manichees, the Donatists and Pelagius. His works: Confessions, City of God and over 500 homilies are well known and appreciated in the West. For his sublime achievements in theology and spirituality, the Latin Church rewarded him with a title: the ``Doctor of Grace.'' He composed a Rule that is observed by some 150 religious communities today. It was his Rule that was given to our Founding Fathers to follow: the Brothers of St. Paul the First Hermit. On December 13, 1308 with the decree ``Ubi Saecularia'', signed by Pope Clement V, through the mediation of his Legate, Cardinal Gentilis de Monte Florido, our Order was officially approved by the Church and the Rule of St. Augustine was assigned to it to live by.}

O St. Augustine, wondrous Doctor of Grace! You wrote and sang of God's merciful love that worked wonders in your soul. Help us to trust in God's help alone. You knew the tragedy of sin. You experienced the darkness of error and the chains of pride and sensuality and endured the pain of alienation from God. But the Lord saw the tears and heard the supplications of your saintly mother, Monica. Because of her unceasing prayer, God in his great mercy, rescued you from the darkness of Satan and immersed you in his divine light.
\smallbreak

O great St. Augustine! Help us to discover God as our eternal Truth, as our true Love and as our beloved Eternity. Teach us to believe in Him and to remain in the state of grace always. Teach us to pray constantly to overcome the weakness of our flesh. Accompany us on our pilgrimage to the endless Life. Pray for us to know the Lord better, to love Him more and to be worthy to reign with Him forever and ever. Amen.

\instruction{St. Casimir, a son of King Casimir Jaggielonczyk and Elizabeth Rakuska was born October 3, 1458 in Cracow at the royal castle of Wawel. He died March 4, 1484 and was buried at the Cathedral of Vilnius (Lithuania) where his relics are venerated to this day. His cult was approved by the Holy See in 1521 and ratified again by Pope Clement VIII in 1602. The same Pope also affirmed the liturgical texts of the Holy Mass and Divine Office and extended the feast of St. Casimir to be celebrated by the Universal Church.}
\smallbreak

\instruction{St. Casimir was noted for his special grace of prayer and a filial devotion to the Mother of God, His favoured hymn to Mary was, ``Omni die, dic Mariae'' (sing to Mary every day). The text of this hymn was enclosed in his coffin. Along with his father he used to come to the Shrine of Our Lady of Jasna Gora. In 1472 the whole royal family prayed before the Miraculous Image and received Holy Communion. On that day, the royal family was admitted to the Pauline Confraternity, including the future saint, St. Casimir.}

\section{Saint Hedwig}

\instruction{St. Hedwig, Queen of Poland (1374 - 1399). During the Canonization Mass, June 8, 1997 on the Great Meadows of Cracow, Pope John Paul II in his homily, said the following, ``It was from the Back Crucifix, venerated at the royal Cathedral of Wawel that St. Hedwig learned her deep wisdom and love for the poor and suffering. It was from the contemplation of that famed Cross and her personal union with the Crucified Lord that she never lost the ``best part'' (cf Lk 10: 42), the presence of Christ. Today, we wish to kneel with you, Hedwig, at the foot of that Cross of Wawel, to be able to hear an echo of that divine lesson you once heard. From you, Hedwig, we want to learn how to realize this divine lesson in our days.''}
\smallbreak

\instruction{St. Hedwig is very close to our Pauline Order for many reasons because of the historical ties between Poland and Hungary. Her father, Louis the Angevin was a great benefactor and supporter of the Pauline Order in Hungry and in Poland through his deputy, the Prince Ladislaus of Opole, who according to tradition, brought the miraculous image of Our Lady of Czestochowa to Poland in 1383 and entrusted it to the Pauline Monks, invited from the Hungarian Monastery Maria Nosztra. We are in possession of a document issued on February 24, 1393 and signed by the King Ladisalus Jagiello, the King of Poland and husband of St. Hedwig, who confirmed the foundation of the Monastery of Jasna Gora, initiated by Prince Laislaus of Opole. It is most probable that the King was greatly influenced by his saintly wife, Hedwig, to make such a decision. Her mission was one of personal sacrifice to bring the nations to the Catholic Church. As a young lady, she was chosen as Queen of Poland by the Polish nobles. She fulfilled her mission of personal sacrifice when she broke her engagement with Wilhelm Habsburg, and married a much older and wild'' Duke of Lithuania, Ladislaus Jagiello, the future King of Poland, in order to bring him and all the Lithuanians to the Catholic Faith. Thus, she became the ``godmother'' of Catholic Lithuania and began a mission of evangelization. With her great heart and wisdom she embraced all her subjects with love, especially the poor and underprivileged. She gave away much of her personal treasures to found the Jagiellonian University in Cracow, one of the best universities in Europe to this day.}
\smallbreak

\instruction{The life of St. Hedwig is deeply associated with the mystery of the Cross. It serves the Pauline Order as an eminent reminder of its mission of the Cross. The first Monastery of the Paulines in Hungary was founded under the sign of the Holy Cross. In Cracow the Pauline Monastery on the ``Skałka'' (a little rock) is a short distance from the Wawel Castle. In both places, the mystery of the Cross remains an object of deep contemplation and a source of spiritual strength. St. Hedwig gives us a shining example of that special love of the Holy Cross.}

\chapter{Prayers for vocations}

\instruction{The Constitutions of our Order impose on all the members an obligation to foster and pray for religious vocations as the Lord has requested, ``the harvest is rich, but the labourers are few, so ask the Lord of the harvest to send labourers to his harvest (Mt 9:27). Encouraged, therefore, by Christ himself, ``let all members intercede before God that he might constantly renew our Monastic Community and enrich it with new members'' (art. 63). Also, the General Directory reminds us of our duty to pray for an increase of good vocations, ``each Pauline Community must pray for many solid vocations to the Order, especially during the noon adoration of the Most Blessed Sacrament. Moreover, Superiors are responsible for arranging in each of our churches a designated week and specified days of prayer for vocations'' (nor. 72).}
\smallbreak

\section{Prayer of Pope Pius VI}

O Jesus Christ the Divine Shepherd! You have sent your Apostles to be the shepherds of souls. Draw to yourself warm and noble minds of young and generous men and make them your followers and servants of all.
\smallbreak

Grant that they may share your desire for the universal salvation for which you renew your Sacrifice on our altars everywhere. You are the Lord of all, who lives forever. Therefore, open before them new horizons that they may see and hear an unspeakable prayer for the light of truth and warmth of love of all their brothers and sisters today. Give them the courage to say ``yes'' to your invitation to continue your mission on earth in building up your Mystical Body, the Church. Make them the light of the world and the salt of the earth.
\smallbreak

We pray also that you may inspire many pure and magnanimous hearts of women and pour into them the desire for Evangelical perfection and dedication to serve the Church in their sisters and brothers in need. Amen.
\smallbreak

\section{Prayer for religious vocations}

O Good Jesus, our Lord and Saviour! Remember the words you have spoken; ``Ask the lord of the harvest to send labourers to the harvest''. With an unshakeable trust, through the intercession of your Immaculate Mother and our Mother and Queen of Jasna Gora and through the intercession of St. Paul the First Hermit, our Father, we pray that you may look down kindly upon our religious family and bless us abundantly. May we live in the spirit of our Constitutions and ever increase in your grace before God and men. May it grow in number with new sons, whom you call for your greater glory.
\smallbreak

Speak to them again today, ``Come follow me'' Make them worthy of your confidence and make them well disposed to carry on the mission of your Church. May they shine forth with personal sanctity, knowledge and untiring love in spreading your Kingdom on earth. To you along with the Father and the Holy Spirit be glory and honour forever and ever. Amen.
\smallbreak

\section{Prayer for fervent priests and religious}

O God of Mercy! You desire the salvation of all people. For this, your only begotten Son came to us as the Good Shepherd to search out and rescue those who were lost. You have given your Son his first disciples and priests to carry on this work of redemption in his Name until the end of time. To us however, you have recommended we ask you, the Lord of the Harvest, to send labourers to your vineyard. Therefore, we pray most fervently, that you may give to the Holy Church of your Son many fervent, saintly priests and religious. Choose and call them yourself from among your people and that no one undesirable to you may remain with us and that no one called by you be unwelcome. Guide them with the grace of the Holy Spirit as you once prepared your Apostles and disciples of Christ.
\smallbreak

May they find joy in the contemplation of your Word. Pour into their hearts your warm love towards you, fidelity and filial affection for the Holy Church and St. Peter, the Rock, on which you have built your Holy Church.
\smallbreak

May they work tirelessly in your vineyard always with prudent and reasonable fervour. Give them a spirit of gentleness and compassion for the weak and erring. May they expect the results of their labour only from you, in humility, prayer and mortification. May they look for nothing else, except your glory and the salvation of souls. We ask all this through your only-begotten Son, Jesus Christ, the Eternal High Priest and the Shepherd of our souls, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, One God forever and ever. Amen.
\smallbreak

\section{Prayer to Our Lady of Jasna Gora for priestly vocations}

Our Lady of Jasna Gora, Most Holy Mother of Jesus Christ, our High Priest! Your Son has made you the Mother of all priests when he entrusted his beloved disciple John to you as your son.
\smallbreak

Mother of Priests! We ask you to watch over those your Son chooses to be his representatives and sharers in his priestly dignity. Pray for them, that they never lose this priestly vocation but remain faithful to the end, working fervently for the souls entrusted to their pastoral care.
\smallbreak

Mother of Priests! Pray for our fathers and mothers that they may offer their Sons with joy to serve your Son as priests.
\smallbreak

Mother of Priests! Implore for us the grace of understanding and appreciation for all the blessings which God bestows upon us through his holy priests. Amen.
\smallbreak

\section{Prayer to the Holy Spirit for good priestly vocations}

O God the Holy Spirit! You are the Supreme Teacher of all the faithful. On the Day of Pentecost, you descended upon the Apostles gathered in the Cenacle, in the form of fiery tongues, that they would become worthy dispensers of your divine mysteries. We pray that you may bestow the fullness of your gifts on all priests who are administering the mission of Jesus Christ and are your instruments in guiding the faithful to salvation.
\smallbreak

Grant them the gifts of wisdom, skill, knowledge, counsel, courage and piety. Fill them with the holy fear of God. Invest them with your abundant graces, that they may teach us in word and example and lead us safely to eternal life, where you receive glory with God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ, forever and ever. Amen.
\smallbreak

\section{Prayer for worthy priests and religious}

O God the Shepherd and Teacher of the faithful! To preserve the deposit of your Church and to ensure its salvific mission, your have instituted the holy Priesthood. You have told your Apostles, ``The harvest is rich, but the labourers are few. Ask the Lord of the Harvest to send more labourers into his harvest.''
\smallbreak

Behold, we approach you with our heartfelt request and we beg you to send more priests and religious to your Holy Church.
\smallbreak

O Lord, give them the courage to say ``yes'' to your calling. Protect them from all dangers of the world. Invest them with the spirit of counsel, strength, wisdom and piety. Fill them with the spirit of your holy fear, that blessed with the precious gift of priesthood or religious profession, they may teach us how to walk on the road of your commandments and bring us to the union with you, who lives and reigns forever and ever. Amen.
\smallbreak

\section{Prayer of Pope John Paul II}

O Jesus the Good Shepherd! Accept our humble adoration and thanksgiving for all vocations which, through your Holy Spirit, give unceasingly to your Church. Support the bishops, priests, missionaries and all consecrated persons. Grant them the grace to be an example of a true Evangelical life. Give them the strength of perseverance in their resolutions in preparation for their holy service. Multiply the workers of the Gospel to bring the Good News to all nations. Surround the children and youth of our families and of our religious communities with your protection. Give them the spirit of generosity and magnanimity to follow you, especially in our times. Give all the invited the energy to leave everything and to choose you, who are Love. Forgive the hesitations and infidelities of those you have already called.
\smallbreak

O Christ our Lord! Graciously hear our petitions through the intercession of the Most Holy Virgin Mary, your Mother and the Queen of the Apostles. May she who believed and generously said ``yes'' to your invitation, be the cause of joy, and accompany those you have called with her maternal presence and example in the service for your Kingdom. Amen.

\section[Prayer for vocations]{Prayer for vocations \\ {\small\normalfont (Message of the Holy Father John Paul II \\ delivered at the XXXII World Day of Vocations).}}

Lord Jesus Christ, our Master! We stand before you and intently listen to your calling, ``Ask the Lord of the Harvest to send labourers to his harvest'' (Mt 9:38). Moved with these words, which you constantly direct to us, we pray that the young people of today may clearly discover and make the right choice for their state of life. Conscious of a great responsibility for an increase of vocations, we beg you with trust and insistency for this great gift for the Church. Every new vocation is a precious gift, obtained only by prayer and holiness of life.
\smallbreak

You O Lord are the source of every vocation. You choose for each of us the way of life and give us a personal role to play in your Church. Open the hearts and minds of young men and women, that a fresh bloom of holy vocations may remind the world of your love, and that all may come to know Jesus Christ, the true Light who has come into the world to bring an unfailing hope of eternal life to all men.
\smallbreak

Be praised Lord in all those, who have discerned their vocation, in accordance with your thought --- and lead them on the right path.
\smallbreak

We thank you, God, for the pastoral care of the church for the youth, and bound with this care that of vocations. The young man, living the gift of youth, stood by you and asked:
\smallbreak
\begin{itemize} \item What do I need to do, to gain eternal life? \item What do I need to do, for my life to have purpose? \item What is God's plan for my life? \item What is God's will for me? \end{itemize}\smallbreak

Lord Jesus, your loving gaze gives youthful hearts the capacity to ask these essential questions. The experience of the meeting between the human heart and Your heart, filled with gentle goodness, gives the strength to seek the answers. Awareness that God loves us allows us with an open heart to receive your answer. Follow me!

\chapter{Meditation}

The Pauline spirituality enrichens itself with the unceasing, centuries old, varieties of forms of prayer. However above all we need to choose the \textit{optiamam patrem} (the better part) of Mary the sister of Lazarus and Martha, which is meditation, the beginning of the spiritual life. Not without the spice of attic salt, did Fr Andrew Eggerer OSPPE write about our semi-contemplative life, in his first volume of his Pauline annals, published in the year 1663: ``so too did our fathers in the hermitages and then in the cenobiums of Hungary. Thus fulfilling the service of the busy Martha, at the same time they did not cease abiding with Magdalen at the feet of Jesus, giving themselves over to the contemplation of heavenly things. Let them remember of how they ought not to imitate those who today in monasteries live only for their stomachs, complaining about the yoke of the work of their own hands.''
\smallbreak

Quite so, in these now distant years, the discerned inspiration of the Holy Spirit, found its place in our spirituality of meditations. Which although it is a passive prayer, beginning in secret, bears its results visibly not only in the whole life of the monk, but also in the Order and finally in the Church. The almighty is a hidden God and His Son lead a hidden life for many years, only to shine later in the preaching of the Gospel and the numerous miracles which finally shone forth in his conquering of death and his resurrection.
\smallbreak

Consecrated persons, likewise, experience an incomparable role in the hidden life of Jesus, in which they practice prayer, which is not for show, but seeks the closed doors of cell, in which God, who sees that which is hidden and repays that, which we cannot fully express (cf. Mt 6:6). In the decree \textit{Perfectae Caritatis, }that is the decree on the adaptation and the renewal of Religious life, in point 6, we read:
\smallbreak
\begin{addmargin}[\parindent]{\parindent} 6. Let those who make profession of the evangelical counsels seek and love above all else God who has first loved us (cf. 1 John 4:10) and let them strive to foster in all circumstances a life hidden with Christ in God (cf. Col. 3:3). This love of God both excites and energizes that love of one's neighbour which contributes to the salvation of the world and the building up of the Church. This love, in addition, quickens and directs the actual practice of the evangelical counsels. Drawing therefore upon the authentic sources of Christian spirituality, members of religious communities should resolutely cultivate both the spirit and practice of prayer. In the first place they should have recourse daily to the Holy Scriptures in order that, by reading and meditating on Holy Writ, they may learn "the surpassing worth of knowing Jesus Christ" (Phil. 3:8). They should celebrate the sacred liturgy, especially the holy sacrifice of the Mass, with both lips and heart as the Church desires and so nourish their spiritual life from this richest of sources. So refreshed at the table of divine law and the sacred altar of God, they will love Christ's members as brothers, honour and love their pastors as sons should do, and living and thinking ever more in union with the Church, dedicate themselves wholly to its mission. \end{addmargin}\smallbreak

The conciliar decree explains the manner of life of consecrated persons and defines them, as hidden in Christ, the foundations of such an approach we see in the every-day immersion in the Sacred Scriptures. Twice appears the phrase, ``above all'', highlighting the priority of this practice, which forms our order's identity: above all prayer, and first prayer amongst prayers, the seeking of Christ in the Sacred Scriptures! Secondly, the Council draws attention to the tight link between meditation and preaching with the Eucharist. To learn about Christ not only out of sheer curiosity or out of intellectual endeavour, but solely to create a relationship of Love, of friendship, which will always deepen, which will not cease but will overflow onto the People of God. This is the fundamental vocation of every consecrated person. For this to happen, meditation of the Word of God, must have a privileged place in our Monastic society.
\smallbreak

St Thomas Aquinas in his famous \textit{Summa Theologiae}, wrote: \textit{necessaria est iugis oratio} --- the yoke of prayer is necessary --- everyday, like in a yoke we ought to meditate, because a repeated habitual action, not episodic, lastingly changes a man. A monk without meditation is like a mindless person, capable only of unsettling himself and others with egocentric ambitions or fears. Jesus in every spare moment, utilised His time in meditation. He had the ethos of reading the scrolls of the Torah and personal prayer in mediation, of which writes the evangelist Luke, whilst speaking of the habits of Jesus, that his is an unchanging practice of prayer (cf. Lk 4:16-17; 22:39-40).
\smallbreak

The ethos of a monk ought to be the same, like the practice of Jesus. Ετος in Greek is the same as our word ``habit,'' that is; a permanent disposition towards action, the practice of a particular thing or expressing it in the light of the gospel, a sweet yoke and a light burden. Although giving time every day to mediation may seem as a burden for our bodies, nevertheless it makes our lives spiritually light. It should become our saving passion, because only passion protects us from damming addictions. The habit of prayer and meditation on the Word of God, not only protects us against addictions, but also opens heaven to us, because it is exactly that, a new plain of existence, knowing that the one we were born into will suffer destruction (cf. Lk 3:21). The passion of meditation contains strength surpassing all human obsessions and opens him to a higher level of existence, that is the sharing in the very life of God. St John Chrysostom believed that no one could remain in sin, who ceaselessly harnesses himself in the yoke of prayer and meditation on the Scriptures. In our newest Pauline constitutions, article 27 speaks of Sacred Scripture as the source of our meditation, which we must cultivate, whole heartedly in our everyday lives, for it is the fundamental method of dialogue with God and directs us towards Mary, who from her earliest earthly years, kept and meditated in her heart His Words.
\smallbreak

An exceptional distinction for the order was the arrival, at a particular time, of the miraculous icon of Jasna Góra into the heart of our order, as well as the discernment of the movement of the Holy Spirit directing to our community to care for the People of God, particularly those in marian shrines. She herself, even before she became the Mother of God, the Virgin listening and meditating, directs the Paulines. It does not behove us to omit the central detail of the architecture of the church that puts before us the pattern of imitating her, and thus in such a way, like her, to accept and come to know Jesus Christ.
\smallbreak

The Mother of Jesus is a model of faith, because she is unmatched in the listening to and meditating on the mysteries of the Word of God. The freedom of God and the freedom of man meet uniquely in meditation, opening forth the event of the annunciation in Nazareth. God turns to man with the Word saturated with Life, for life is most radically attributed to God, whereby the reception of Him is very much similar to conception. The Synoptic Evangelists recall the visit of the relatives of Jesus, who standing outside a house in which He was teaching, sought to meet with Him. Then He said these words, which for many seem troublesome, when at the same time they are an invitation to the accept with a discerning heart His words and thanks to them fulfil the will of God: `` My mother and My brothers are those who, hear the word of God and keep it.'' (cf. Lk 8:21).
\smallbreak

Adrienne von Speyr interpreted this response of Jesus, as a renouncement of the rights of Motherhood in regards to the Son of God in favour of all who like Mary whole-heartedly nourish themselves on His Words. St Augustine in his homily on the Birth of Christ, said, ``The Mother who carried Him in her womb, we carry also in our hearts (\ldots ) Let us not be infertile -- let our hearts be fertile in God.'' St Ambrose similarly courageously commented on this mysterious response of Jesus: ``He fulfilled the will of the Father, that you would become the Mother of Christ.'' Because our thoughts are not His thoughts, (Is 55:8) it is vitally important to devote time to meditation, so that the words of God read in the bible become incarnate in the received experienced of the Monk. So that he may become ever more similar to the Mother of the Saviour, just as it took place in the life of Mary, in whom the Word became flesh, and the thoughts of her meditated prayers were fulfilled in the events of her fate.
\smallbreak

It is not by accident, that just as the landmark events for a Pauline, the clothing in the habit and Solemn Vows take place on Solemnities on which the church reads the gospel pericope of the annunciation (8 XII ad 25 III). A radical otherness of the Word of God to the human intellect always causes the monk to firstly purify his thoughts and quieten his interior before beginning to meditate. Fr Gregory Terecy, (+1660) in his \textit{Conversio morum Paulinorum, }recommends that in preparation for meditation that the monk casts far away from himself all useless thoughts, phantasms, memories and all connotations bounded up with human aspirations and fears, which depart from the subject of the meditation. Thus meditation for the Pauline is a personal incarnation -- thanks to this personal prayer, the presence of the Holy Spirit makes our consecrated lives really spiritual, not only by profession, but also by practice. Meditation upon the Word of God fully develops faith, creating the best environment for the living out of the Eucharist, as the source of our saving life in a vivacious, conscious and loving way. In the Pauline constitutions from the year 1930 we find more than an encouragement not to omit meditation, but we also find the Prior being obligated to whole heartedly care for meditations of the monks entrusted to his care. For as we read in chapter XII ``Our Order, thanks to holy meditation and contemplation was once flourishing.''(68) Certainly the roots of such an obligation to meditation reach to the constitution from the year 1644, where in point 10, we can read even stronger words, where the growth of our order is dependent on this very form of prayer. A Pauline, even if he could not participate in the communal morning meditation or the evening one, then he is obliged to fulfil personally his mediation, even if he must give up his free time to do so. The Sub-prior was even obliged to question the monks on the effects of their meditations. The care then of this prayer, though the ages, was regarded as the foundation of very life and strength of the order itself. Likewise, every fall in the spiritual life always began with a falling away from this sublime form of prayer. In the Rule of Bartholomew of the five churches, from the year 1215, dedicated to the Hermits of Patacs, meditation and prayer took first place among the many activities of the monks.
\smallbreak

The Monks of Jasna Góra in the XVII century rose at midnight, so that after Matins, they could do half an hour of meditation. This is written in the manuscripts of Jasna Góra and it convinces us that among the forms of prayer, the Paulines gave great weight to this form. This was not a meditation removed from their lives nor from the bible, drifting into ideal and theoretical subjects, because in the Pauline \textit{Liber Meditationis,} (1630) proposes meditation under its first section, entitled: \textit{De magnitudine malitiae peccati -- }Concerning the great malice of Sin. During the expanse of the centuries, the methods of mental prayer were greatly influenced by Carmelite and Jesuit currents; nevertheless, they were inclined to follow the exhortations of the previous council, encouraging the practice of \textit{lectio divina. }It is necessary to underline that the method used by every community and each one of us is adapted to our spiritual characters, modifying and making them a more vivacious and robust to use.
\smallbreak

At the source of \textit{lectio divina }lies the method that was systemised by the Cathurisan Guido II, the Angelic (+1188) in his \textit{opusculum} entitled \textit{Scala Claustralium: LECTIO} (reading) \textit{MEDITATIO} (meditation), \textit{ORATIO} (prayer), \textit{CONTEMPLATIO} (contemplation). Due to Pauline Spirituality not being limited to the work of contemplation but likewise ordered towards the apostolic work, shares its own won spiritual treasures, through working in the confessional, through preaching, through retreats, days of recollection and through spiritual direction. We can confidently adapt the Carthusian method to our spiritual needs with one additional point: \textit{PRONUNTIATIO} (Proclamation) in accordance with the words of Our Lord: ``What I tell you in the dark, utter in the light; and what you hear whispered, proclaim upon the housetops.'' (Mt 10:27).
\smallbreak

The mother of our redeemer did likewise when after Gabriel's annunciation, directed to her in the darkness of meditation, she left to the far away land of Ajn Karim. That under the roof of the house of Elizabeth she could fulfil the hymn, which every day in vespers reminds us of the necessity of the transmission of the faith to others. In connection with this, it behoves us, not to treat our meditation solely as some private prayer, rather as a preparation for a homily, recollection or some other form of evangelisation. Every page of sacred scripture is like a well, from which we need to draw water, to quench the soul's thirst of the Holy Spirit, just as the Samaritan widow at Sychar was thirsty for Love. Because nothing encourages more than an example, let us offer a short example of meditation, to illustrate its process. Due to many of us using readings from the Liturgy for mediation, it is good to remember that the liturgical readings do not contain the entirety of the Sacred Scriptures.

\section{A Proposed Mediation}

Having in mind the good of those among us who are in formation, let us use the readings from the lectionary in tome V, from the 33\textsuperscript{rd} Week of Ordinary time, year II, Tuesday: Rev 3:1-6;14-22; Ps 15, 1b-3a. 3bc-4.5; Lk 19:1-10.
\smallbreak

At the \textit{LECTIO} stage, in recollection, we familiarise ourselves with the contents of the texts by reading all three pericopes to find a central theme. It is good, in the day before, particularly in the evening before, to read the texts and become familiar with them, so that even before we sleep, we can begin a preliminary meditation on the texts. It is important to note particular details that catch our attention. This work ought to be done in solitude, in accordance with our motto -- Alone with God alone. Our primary focus could be a word, which appears in two or three liturgical readings, or a thought, or a dominating idea throughout the texts. We should not ignore the biblical contexts of the chosen fragments, which we have chosen. The bible too, itself was written for catechetical purposes and does not lack meaningful neighbouring contents. For this proposed meditation, we shall use the concept of \textit{seeking God.} The reading from revelations encourages us to seek Jesus without fooling ourselves. That by the name, therefore the identity of the one we are seeking would become a reality, which expresses, one dead spiritually coming to life. That one masking his poverty and greed would become spiritually wealthy. Frequently an impoverished soul seeks gratification in material opulence. How very high does one have to climb spiritually to fulfil the requirements asked by Psalm 15? Only one honest and free from greed can climb the mountain of the Lord. In the background of these readings is the gospel of St Luke, which already appears as a concrete reality, but not without its mystical shades, become \textit{sui generis} the matrix of conversion.
\smallbreak

Finding all the common themes of the readings -- in this case -- the search for God and not wealth is the first goal of the \textit{LECTIO} stage. In this stage, we need to mention an additional step: \textit{DIVINATIO}, that is a deepening of the texts, directed by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. A great help in this stage would be something of a biblical lexicon, a dictionary of symbols, or a biblical concordance. An inestimable treasure here is the knowledge of the original languages. That is why, during our time in the seminary, the \textit{ratio studiorum, }foresees at least the learning of the Greek language. Using a interlinear version and dictionary not only allows us to find the correct translation of words, but also to find the place in the bible, in which word occurs, and through a comparison find a broader and fuller meaning to the word. A beneficial practice is the writing down of our meditations, a \textit{LECTIO} \textit{SCRIPTA}, for this helps in recollection and, particularly in the morning, fights against distractions, likewise it allows us to practise the style of a future homily. We must not forget that zelous evangelisation is also part of our charism (Pauline Constitutions 3.4).
\smallbreak

The third stage is \textit{MEDITATIO}, that is discursive meditation. This is the leaving behind the continuity of theme, it is an attempt to discern the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, the taking root of the found ideas and a weaving of them together into a complete whole. All the possible thoughts capable of being reflected on should be written down. The act of writing multiplies thoughts and orders them and this in turn causes the meditation to become clear and more easily finds its place in the memory, almost like a seal. The mother of our Lord, when the Angel illuminated the will of God, meditated in her heart, but the original text used the word διαλογιζομαι (dialogizomai) which means meditating with care (Mt 6:7-8), with the desire to understand. Moreover, even to attempt to comprehend that which is incompressible or begets fear (Lk 5:21-22), or likewise the internal struggle (Lk 24:38) and finally the ideal that appears from the very depths of the subconscious (Lk 2:35). All these biblical passages concern themselves with an intense discernment, which does not lack internal tension, attempting to understanding with effort, which will lead to an understanding, not only of this Divine mystery, but also our very inner most self, the personal subconscious. \textit{MEDITATIO} then is the work of the intellect, at such a level, which is achieved thanks to the grace of faith in knowing Jesus Christ, in which the mystery of man becomes known to man himself.
\smallbreak

The coincidental text concerning Zacchaeus, is associated liturgically with the reading from Revelations and with Psalm 15, may lead us to our next discovery in this state of MEDITATIO. Psalm 15 for the reader may be similar to a glance in a mirror, because which one of us can climb the mountain of the Lord's holiness, searching for Him, without any blemish of sin or fault. The just, speaking not only the truth with the lips, but also with his heart, who of us does not lie, who never harmed anyone, or has not discovered in themselves some greed or some higher aspirations? Zacchaeus was a greedy liar, having committed many frauds and the many people he harmed he held in contempt. His name, Zacchaeus, may be translated as ``pure'' or ``innocent,'' but his life was very much contradicted his name. His personage ideally fits the accusations in the apocalyptic letters address to Laodicea and Sardis, which speak of him who has a name, that means that he is alive, but is in fact dead. He was rich materially, but poor in conscience. Nevertheless, what could save him was the irresistible desire to see Jesus, which he expressed whilst searching for him. ``He wanted to necessarily see Jesus!'' When this happened, Zacchaeus' life changed dramatically, from a greedy abuser he became a merciful alms giver. Of particular value is the key phrase of ``He wanted to see Jesus.'' A literal translation of the original is ``he sought to see Jesus.'' This searching ζετεο (Zeteo) appears again in the same Gospel of Luke, at this moment, thanks to the Greek dictionary or a biblical concordance. Mary along with Joseph were looking for Jesus in the temple of Jerusalem. After finding him, Mary says: ``Behold, your father and I have been looking for you anxiously.'' (Lk 2:48) Looking in an English -- Greek dictionary, we see, that this word, ζετεο can likewise also mean to discern, therefore to meditate, that is mentally and spiritually attempting to comprehend something. So thus, Mary and Joseph not only were searching for Our Lord in the streets of Jerusalem, but they were also searching for him with their hearts, with their anxious hearts. This unsettling anxiety, accompanies every person, until they find Our Lord. They sought for him with their souls, their thoughts, their emotions with their troubled thoughts. The essence of real mediation is not to contain oneself solely to one's half-hour morning or evening meditation, but to personally, most deeply seek to know and to discover the truth not only about our redeemer, but also about ourselves. Setting the bounds of our dialogue with Our Lord in such a way, allows us to adhere to Him and come to love Him more fully. Searching strenuously does not limit itself to only half an hour, but expands itself to seek understanding, in all available aids: beginning firstly from the Fathers of the Church and ending with exegetical commentaries, lexicons and dictionaries, so as to comprehend the scriptures most fully. Following such a comprehension and understanding comes the possibility of drawing closer to Our Lord and only then give us a chance for love. All evil stems from a focusing on oneself and all good from focusing all ones strength on God. The stage of \textit{MEDITATIO} can last even a few days, because the consultation of sources and the search of a library may take us quite some time. We should not be restrained only by the morning's half hour, but should use every free moment we have to deepen the subject, which we are mediating upon.
\smallbreak

\subsection*{Oratio}

The thorough intellectual study, using all possible sources and means, as mentioned above, open our horizons for the feeling of wonder, sadness, compunction, an honest look at one's self and awakens a desire better life to the one we have led to this moment. The movements of our emotions, which have accompanied us in our mediation, require us certainly to turn towards God in prayer, in the most personal form of prayer, deep and sincere. The wider the confession, the stronger a bond appears between Our Lord and ourselves. Identifying with Zacchaeus, we climb the Sycamore, which earlier symbolised human pride and the will for power or greed, thanks to the desire of seeing the Lord, becomes and illustration of the ascent to the highest levels of the desire for God, which is capable of changing our entire lives. Prayer in the grunts and words of the spirit in the end transform into the contemplative gazing upon the Lord. Therefore, the next stage of \textit{Lectio Divina }is \textit{CONTEMPLATIO}.
\smallbreak

\subsection*{Contemplatio}

In this moment of our mediation, we ought to fall silent in all our dialogues with ourselves and even with the Lord Himself. Placing ourselves before the ineffable Word of God, which did the impossible, became man, and communicated to us the greatest news, pushes man to silence filled with awe and praise. God always remains incomprehensible, even thought He should always be known. St Ephraim the Syrian wrote that to hold that one has understood The Word is the greatest desecration, because it implies the conviction that the knower is greater than the object of the thing known. The stage \textit{CONTEMPLATIO} allows man to remind himself the seriousness of silence in the presence of the revealed mystery, which will always remind a mystery, regardless of the understanding and insight gained through from Mediation. This stage is good to do in front of the Blessed Sacrament during a time of adoration, which ought to be a natural crowning of a monastic day. Without this gazing into the countenance of Christ, without adoration of the Blessed Sacrament in the atmosphere of the complete morning mediation, \textit{As a consequence life itself loses meaning, the faces of brothers and sisters are obscured and it becomes impossible to }\textit{recognise}\textit{ the face of God in them. (Starting Afresh from Christ III.25) }Moments of contemplation, which allows us to be raptured into the gaze of the face of the Lord, through the ascent of the sycamore of Zacheus, the whole of our consecrated life is renewed, as St John Paul II expressed on his homily on the 2\textsuperscript{nd} of February 2001.
\smallbreak

\subsection*{Pronuntiatio}

The whole material, gathered, written down and ordered within the few days becomes a holy basis, from which we can firstly share with the community in the form of \textit{COLLATIO}, which springs from the eremitical tradition and later with the faithful in the church during the homily or a spiritual conference. In this way mediation, which begins with being alone with God along, becomes an enrichment to the brothers and finally with the People of God. The instruction of the congregation for institutes of consecrated life, 2002, entitled ``To begin afresh from Christ,'' tells us that consecrated persons only when they are themselves nourished with the Word of God, having become new people, free people, evangelic people and thus so authentic servants in the work of evangelisation and strongly convincing, are able to bring the fruit of our prayers to others. (III, 24) The riches of experience and reflection and finally the treasure of being enraptured by the face of the Lord, after a well prayed mediation, finds its crowning moment in adoring contemplation in His presence in the Blessed Sacrament, begs us to share our experience with others, for we are debtors of the Church noless than Zacchaeus, who promised to repay his debts, in the indebting promise he gave to the Lord. The conciliar decree on the ministry and life of priests, \textit{Presbyterorum Ordinis,} already in its first chapter, states \textit{their ministry, which begins with the evangelical proclamation}, although the peak is the leading of someone to the full participation in the Eucharist united with Our Lord. The Council even more insistently reminds the priest of this duty in the fourth point of the second chapter where it states \textit{The People of God are joined together primarily by the word of the living God, and rightfully they expect this from their priests.} Regardless of this obligation directed to priest, which for better or for worse, eloquently or not so, is always and everywhere to preach the Gospel is not left in any doubt, as to the role of mediation upon the Word of God, which is the first step to evangelisation.
\smallbreak

If Zacchaeus did not climb the sycamore, to see Jesus, a great many people would not have been repaid or enriched by him. If a monk does not consciously strive to mediation, which is like climbing the tree of coming to the knowledge of one true and good God, a great many people would not have the debt of their salvation repaid. Zacchaeus gave half his wealth to the poor and those harmed by him were quadrupolly repaid. Sharing the wealth of mediation allows the church to be rewarded and enriched with the treasure of the wisdom which is hidden in Christ. This is also the duty of consecrated life. In this very same point of \textit{Presbyterorum Ordinis} that priests are not less so obligated to share the truths of the Gospel of which they are ministers of. The Latin text of this document, in this place, uses the word \textit{debitores} -- debtors! The ordained priest is a debtor of the church, similar to one who has in his possession a key to a treasury, which is possessed by the whole church. What good is a house fully of gold, if no one was able to open its doors? The key to the treasury, which is the treasure of all, are possessed by the monk and particularly by the priest. If they do not share any of the treasure, they become the debtors of their neighbours as wrote St John Maria Vianney. In spirit of thee charism of our order, which harkens to the tradition of the Egyptian desert hermits, the preaching of the Word of God, heard in solitude, confronted in the community of the brethren, becomes the answer to the insistent demand of those pilgriming to the hermits: ``Abba, say to me a word!''
