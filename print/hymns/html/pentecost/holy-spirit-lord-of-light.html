<hymn title="Holy Spirit, Lord of Light"
      author="Words: Attributed to Innocent III (1160-1216) (Veni, Sancte Spiritus); translated from Latin to English by Edward Caswall, 1848.">
    1. Holy Spirit, Lord of light,
    From the clear celestial height
    Thy pure beaming radiance give.

    2. Come, Thou Father of the poor,
    Come with treasures which endure;
    Come, Thou Light of all that live.

    3. Thou, of all consolers best,
    Thou, the soulâ€™s delightful guest,
    Dost refreshing peace bestow.

    4. Thou in toil art comfort sweet;
    Pleasant coolness in the heat;
    Solace in the midst of woe.

    5. Light immortal, Light divine,
    Visit Thou these hearts of Thine,
    And our inmost being fill.

    6. If You take your grace away,
    Nothing pure in man will stay;
    All our good is turned to ill.

    7. Heal our wounds, our strength renew;
    On our dryness pour Thy dew;
    Wash the stains of guilt away.

    8. Bend the stubborn heart and will;
    Melt the frozen, warm the chill;
    Guide the steps that go astray.

    9. Thou, on us who evermore
    Thee confess and Thee adore,
    with Thy sevenfold gifts descend.

    10. Give them comfort when we die;
    Give them life with Thee on high;
    Give them joys that never end. Amen.
