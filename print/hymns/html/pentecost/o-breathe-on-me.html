<hymn title="O Breathe On Me, Breath Of God"
      author="Edwin Hatch 1835-89">
    1. O breathe on me, Breath of God,
    Fill me with life anew;
    That I may love what Thou dost love,
    And do what Thou wouldst do.

    2. O breathe on me, Breath of God,
    Until my heart is pure;
    Until with Thee I have one will
    To do and to endure.

    3. O breathe on me, Breath of God,
    Till I am wholly Thine,
    Until this earthly part of me
    Glows with Thy fire divine.

    4. O breathe on me, Breath of God,
    So shall I never die,
    But live with Thee the perfect life
    Of Thine eternity.
