        Merciful Jesus, Redeemer of the human race,
        look down upon us humbly kneeling before Your altar.

        We belong to You and we desire to remain Yours forever.

        In order that we may be more strongly united to You,
        Each one of us here today freely offers himself to Your Most Sacred Heart.

        Many indeed have never known You;
        Many have disobeyed Your commandments and rejected You.
        Have mercy on them all, most merciful Jesus,
        and draw them all to Your Most Sacred Heart.

        O Lord, be the king of those who have turned their backs on You,
        as well as of those who have never left You.
        Bring them back to the one true Church,
        so that there may be one fold and one Shepherd.

        O Lord, be the king also of all those who have no religion.
        Deliver them out of the darkness, into the light and Kingdom of God.

        Grant to Your Church, O Lord, freedom and security;
        Give peace and good government to all nations;
        Make the earth ring out from end to end with one voice saying,
        “Praise to the Divine Heart, which has brought about our salvation.
        To Him be glory and honour forever.”

<h2>Act of Consecration to the
    Sacred Heart of Jesus <span>St Margaret María Alacoque</span></h2>

<p>I give myself and consecrate to the Sacred Heart of our Lord Jesus Christ, my person and my life, my actions, pains
    and sufferings, so that I may be unwilling to make use of any part of my being other than to honor, love and glorify
    the Sacred Heart. This is my unchanging purpose, namely, to be all His, and to do all things for the love of Him, at
    the same time renouncing with all my heart whatever is displeasing to Him. I therefore take You, O Sacred heart, to
    be the only object of my love, the guardian of my life, my assurance of salvation, the remedy of my weakness and
    inconstancy, the atonement for all the faults of my life and my sure refuge at the hour of death.
</p>
<p>Be then, O Heart of goodness, my justification before God the Father, and turn away from me the strokes of his
    righteous anger. O Heart of love, I put all my confidence in You, for I fear everything from my own wickedness and
    frailty, but I hope for all things from Your goodness and bounty.
</p>
<p>Remove from me all that can displease You or resist Your holy will; let your pure love imprint Your image so deeply
    upon my heart, that I shall never be able to forget You or to be separated from You.
</p>
<p>May I obtain from all Your loving kindness the grace of having my name written in Your Heart, for in You I desire to
    place all my happiness and glory, living and dying in bondage to You. Amen.
</p>
