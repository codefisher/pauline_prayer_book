<hymn title="O Mary Mother Sweetest Best"
      author="Anonymous">
    1. O Mary Mother, sweetest, best, from Heav’n’s immortal bowers,
    Do gather for a little child a bouquet of sweet flowers.
    I wish my little heart to be a cradle fair and gay,
    Where blessed Jesus may repose on my First Communion day.
    Where blessed Jesus may repose on my First Communion day.

    2. My little child, I can obtain so bright a wreath for thee
    That Jesus will delight to come within thy heart to be.
    I’ll give thee lovely charity, more warm than rose’s glow,
    I’ll give thee heav’nly purity, more white than lily snow.
    I’ll give thee heav’nly purity, more white than lily snow.

    3. The violet of humility shall yield a sweet perfume;
    And Jesus will delight to be within thy little room.
    But then remember, dearest child, the blossoms that I give
    Require the watering of a prayer, or they will cease to live.
    Require the watering of a prayer, or they will cease to live.
