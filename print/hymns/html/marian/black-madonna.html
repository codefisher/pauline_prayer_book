<hymn title="Black Madonna" author="A. Golezewska">
    1. There's a corner of a country, Which the pilgrims gladly seek, 
    Where In glory stands a portrait of a Queen slashed on the cheek.
    She is grieving, she is caring, she invites us everyone:
    “I’m your Mother, be my daughter, be my son.”

    Refrain:
    Madonna, Oh Black Madonna,
    I'm happy Your child to be!
    Oh, grant me, O Black Madonna, that your arms may cradle me.

    2. In your arms we find the refuge and the warmth of your great love.
    In your arms we do find hope, joy and the strength to go through life.
    In your arms is found the saviour, the Bread, the Truth, and our Way.
    In your arms is found the Peace for which we search.
    Refrain
