<h1 class="index">The Prayer for the Consecration of the Family</h1>

<p>
    Sacred Heart of Jesus and Immaculate Heart of Mary, I come to you to consecrate myself and my entire family to your
    Two Hearts. I desire to renew the vows of my baptism and place each member of my family through an act of faith,
    hope and love into loving union with the Holy Family of Jesus, Mary and Joseph. I dedicate myself and each member of
    my family to the Guardian Angels God has given each one of us. O Holy Guardian Angels, enlighten, guide and protect
    each one so as to lead us safely home to heaven.
</p>
<p>
    At Fatima, dear Mother of God, you appeared with St. Joseph and the Child Jesus blessing the world. O Holy Family,
    bestow blessings upon me and my entire family so that we may live the Christ-life. I desire that each member of my
    family adore always the Most Blessed Trinity and love our God in the Most Blessed Sacrament.
</p>
<p>
    Grant peace to each member of my family. Keep each one in the grace of Jesus Christ. Never permit any of my family to
    stray from the true faith. (For any family member who has strayed, I beseech you to bind up the wounds, lift up the
    fallen, restore and keep each of our loved ones in grace. Bid them to come back to their Fatherâ€™s true home.) Amen.
</p>
