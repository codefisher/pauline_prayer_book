    1. Deep in the hinterland, there lies a valley,
    Beauty so green in a sheltered domain.
    Home of the pilgrim or quiet place to rest in,
    a silent retreat at one’s journey’s end.

    Refrain:
    Oh deep in my soul, I hear you call me,
    Mother of mine, to your bush home.
    from the depths of my soul, I shall embrace thee,
    Marian Valley! My heart is thine own.

    2. From Poland to Queensland, the Pauline’s did travel,
    spreading devotion to all near and far.
    We praise thee and thank Thee dear Jesus and Mary,
    for bringing to us the Madonna with scar.
    Refrain

    3. On feast days we gather dear Mary to praise thee,
    to worship your Son in the chapel now grown.
    you welcome all nations, who far from their own land,
    seek comfort and shelter in a new native home.
    Refrain

    4. O, Help of Christians, today we implore you,
    to strengthen our souls from the trials we all share.
    Be to us solace, and grant us protection,
    we pray to you, Mother, for we know you care.
    Refrain

    <em>Coda</em>
    Oh Marian Valley! My heart is thine own
