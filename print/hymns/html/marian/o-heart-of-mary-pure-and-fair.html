<hymn title="O Heart of Mary Pure and Fair">
    1. O heart of Mary pure and fair, there is no stain in thee.
    In Adam’s fall thou had no share; from sins taint thou art free.

    Refrain:
    O Heart of Mary pure and fair, no beauty with thine compare.
    From every stain of sin thou’rt free. Oh make us pure in heart like thee.

    2. As some fair lily midst the thorns, thou &lsquo;amongst Eve’s daughters&rsquo; art;
    Celestial purity adorns thy chaste and holy heart.
    Refrain

    3. Dear heart within thy depths so pure, we’ll dwell and ne’er depart
    Til thou our souls hast link’d secure to Jesus’ Sacred Heart.
    Refrain

    4. And when from thy lov’d heart we’ll go to that of thy dear Son,
    Oh shall we leave thee then, ah no, His heart and thine are one.
    Refrain
