<hymn title="Queen of the Holy Rosary" author="Traditional">
    1. O Queen of the Holy Rosary! Oh! Bless us as we pray.
    And offer thee our roses in garlands day by day.
    While from our Father’s garden with loving hearts and bold,
    We gather to thine honour buds white and red and gold.

    2. O Queen of the Holy Rosary, each mystery bends with thine.
    The sacred life of Jesus, in every step divine.
    Thy soul was His fair garden, they virgin breast His throne
    Thy thoughts His faithful mirror, reflecting Him alone.

    3. Sweet Lady of the Rosary, white roses let us bring;
    And lay them round thy footstool before our Infant King.
    For, nestling in thy bosom, God’s Son was fain to be,
    The Child of thy obedience, and spotless purity.

    4. Dear Lady of the Rosary, red roses cast we down,
    But let thy fingers weave them into a worthy crown.
    For how can we poor sinners do aught but weep with thee,
    When in thy train, we follow our God to Calvary.

    5. O Queen of the Holy Rosary! What radiance of love,
    What splendour and what glory surround thy court above,
    O in thy tender pity, dear source of love untold,
    Refuse not this our offering, our flowers White, Red and Gold.
