<hymn title="O Mary Of Graces"
      author="From an Irish poem; Trans. Douglas Hyde †1949  ">
    1. O Mary of graces and Mother of God,
    May I tread the paths that the righteous have trod.
    And mayest thou save me from evil’s control,
    And mayest thou save me in body and soul.

    2. And mayest thou save me by land and by sea,
    And mayest thou save me from tortures to be.
    May the guard of the angels above me abide,
    May God be before me and God at my side.
</hymn>
