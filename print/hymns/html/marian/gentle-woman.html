    Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you
    Blessed are you among women,
    And blest is the fruit of your womb, Jesus
    Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners
    Now at the hour of our death, Amen
</pslam>

<hymn title="Gentle Woman" author="Rev. Carey Landry">
    Refrain:
    Gentle woman, quiet light
    Morning star so strong and bright
    Gentle Mother, peaceful dove
    Teach us wisdom, teach us love

    1. You were chosen by the father
    You were chosen for the son
    You were chosen from all women
    And for women, a shining one
    Refrain

    2. Blessed are you among women
    Blest in turn all women, too
    Blessed they with peaceful spirits
    Blessed they with gentle hearts
    Refrain
</hymn>
