<hymn title="Bring Flowers of the Rarest">
    1. Bring flow'rs of the rarest,
    Bring blossoms the fairest,
    From garden and woodland
    And hillside and vale;
    Our full hearts are swelling,
    Our Glad voices telling
    The praise of the loveliest,
    Rose of the vale.

    Refrain:
    O Mary! we crown thee with blossoms today,
    Queen of the Angels, Queen of the May,
    O Mary! we crown thee with blossoms today,
    Queen of the Angels, Queen of the May.

    2. Our voices ascending,
    In harmony blending,
    Oh! Thus may our hearts turn
    Dear Mother, to thee;
    Oh! Thus shall we prove thee
    How truly we love thee,
    How dark without Mary
    Life's journey would be.
    Refrain

    3. O Mother the dearest,
    Oh, wilt thou be nearest,
    When life with temptation
    Is darkly replete?
    Forsake us, O never!
    Our hearts be they ever
    As Pure as the lilies
    We lay at thy feet.
    Refrain
