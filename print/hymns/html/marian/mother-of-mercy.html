<hymn title="Mother of Mercy" author="H. F. Hemy">
    1. Mother of Mercy, day by day
    My love of thee grows more and more;
    Thy gifts are strewn upon my way,
    like sands upon the great seashore.

    2. Though poverty and work and woe
    The masters of my life may be,
    When times are worst, who does not know,
    Darkness is light with love of thee?

    3. Give me the grace to love thee more;
    Jesus will give if thou wilt plead;
    And, Mother, when life’s cares are o’er,
    Oh, I shall love thee then indeed.
