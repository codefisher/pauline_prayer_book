<h2>The Memorare</h2>

<p>
    Remember, O most gracious Virgin Mary, that never was it known that anyone who fled to your protection, implored
    your help, or sought your intercession was left unaided. Inspired with this confidence, I fly to you, O Virgin of
    virgins, my Mother; to you do I come; before you I stand, sinful and sorrowful. O Mother of the Word Incarnate,
    despise not my petitions, but in your mercy, hear and answer me. Amen.
</p>

<h2>Consecration to the Immaculate Heart of Mary</h2>

<p>
    O Immaculate Heart of Mary, Queen of Heaven and Earth, and tender Mother of us all, we consecrate to you ourselves,
    our families, our country and the whole human race.
</p>

<p>
    Reign over us and teach us how to make the Heart of Jesus reign and triumph in us and around us. We ask your help
    and especially your prayers for ourselves and all the human race. Lead us all to our salvation through your Son, Our
    Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
