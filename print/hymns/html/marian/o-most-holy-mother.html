<hymn title="O Most Holy Mother">
    1. O most holy mother, blest beyond all other,
    Sweet and meek Virgin Mary; mother beloved by all,
    No sin did make you fall; pray for us to your Son, the Lord of all.

    2. You are our protection, refuge, consolation,
    Maiden, yet mother, Mary; whate’er we hope for,
    Through you we now implore:
    Pray for us to your Son, whom we adore.

    3. Look now on our weakness, tears betray our sadness,
    Turn not from us, O Mary; show us your healing art:
    Bind up our broken heart: pray for us that your Son his grace impart.

    4. May your eyes now turn to those who praise your virtue:
    Hear us now, mother Mary; vessel of election, bringing us protection,
    Pray for those who honour your perfection.

    5. Joys and sorrows bearing, burdens with us sharing;
    Knowing this helps us, Mary. One of us now raised on high,
    Mary, hear your children’s cry:
    Pray for us sinners now, and when we die.
