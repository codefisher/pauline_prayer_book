<hymn title="Mary Most Holy" author="Unknown">
    1. Mary most holy, from your hands falling,
    Are Heaven’s blessings, here us now calling,
    Teach us to pray, and work for God’s glory,
    Ave Maria, Ave.

    2. Help us to witness Christ is still living,
    Service to others cheerfully giving,
    Teach us to pray, and work for God’s glory,
    Ave Maria, Ave.

    3. Through joy and sorrow, each day’s condition,
    Ever dear Mother, hear our petitions,
    Teach us to pray, and work for God’s glory,
    Ave Maria, Ave.
