<hymn title="As I Kneel Before You" author="Maria Parkinson">
    1. As I kneel before you, As I bow my head in prayer,
    Take this day, make it yours and fill me with your love.

    Refrain:
    Ave Maria, Gratia plena, Dominus tecum, Benedicta tu.

    2. All I have I give you, Every dream and wish are yours,
    Mother of Christ, Mother of mine, present them to my Lord.
    Refrain

    3. As I kneel before you, As I see your smiling face,
    Every thought, every word, is lost in your embrace.
    Refrain
