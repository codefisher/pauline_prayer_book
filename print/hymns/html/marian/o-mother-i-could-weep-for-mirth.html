<hymn title="O Mother, I Could Weep for Mirth" author="Swiss Air">
    1. O Mother, I could weep for mirth,
    Joy fills my heart so fast;
    My soul today is heav’n on earth,
    Oh, could the transport last!

    Refrain:
    I think of thee, and what thou art,
    Thy majesty, thy state&mdash;
    And I keep singing in my heart;
    Immaculate! Immaculate!

    2. The angels answer with their songs,
    Bright choirs in gleaming rows;
    And saints flock round thy feet in throngs,
    And heaven with bliss o’er-flows.
    Refrain

    3. Conceived, conceived Immaculate!
    Oh, what a joy for thee
    Conceived, conceived Immaculate!
    Oh, what a joy for me!
    Refrain

    4.It is this thought today that lifts,
    My happy heart to heaven,
    That for our sakes thy choicest gifts,
    To thee, dear Queen, were given
    Refrain

    5.Oh, blessed be the Eternal Son,
    Who joys to call thee Mother,
    And lets poor men, by sin undone,
    For thy sake call Him brother.
    Refrain
