<hymn title="Sing of Mary, Pure and Lowly"
      author="Anonymous">
    1. Sing of Mary, pure and lowly,
    Virgin-Mother undefiled;
    Sing of God’s own Son most holy,
    Who became a little Child.
    Fairest Child of fairest Mother,
    God, the Lord, who came to earth,
    Word-made-flesh, our very Brother,
    Takes our nature by His birth.

    2. Sing of Jesus, Son of Mary,
    In the home at Nazareth.
    Toil and labour cannot weary
    Love enduring unto death.
    Constant was the love He gave her,
    Though He went forth from her side,
    Forth to preach and heal and suffer,
    Till on Calvary He died.

    3. Glory be to God the Father;
    Glory be to God the Son;
    Glory be to God the Spirit;
    Glory to the Three in One.
    From the heart of blessed Mary,
    From all saints the song ascends,
    And the Church the strain re-echoes
    Unto earth’s remotest ends.
