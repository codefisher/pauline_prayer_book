<h1 class="index">The Fatima Prayers</h1>

<h2>The Angel’s Prayer</h2>
<p>
    O most Holy Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, I adore You profoundly.
    I offer You the most Precious Body, Blood,
    Soul, and Divinity of Jesus Christ,
    present in all the tabernacles of the world—in reparation for the outrages,
    sacrileges, and indifference by which He is offended.
    By the infinite merits of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the
    Immaculate Heart of Mary, I beg the conversion of poor sinners.
</p>

<h2>Pardon Prayer</h2>

<p>
    My God, I believe, I adore, I hope, and I love You! I beg pardon for those who do not believe, do not adore, do not
    hope, and do not love You.
</p>

<h2>Eucharistic Prayer</h2>

<p>
    Most Holy Trinity, I adore You!<br/>
    My God, my God, I love You in the Most Blessed Sacrament.
</p>

<h2>Sacrifice Prayer</h2>

<p>
    O my Jesus, it is for love of You, in reparation for the offences<br/>
    committed against the Immaculate Heart of Mary,<br/>
    and for the conversion of poor sinners.
</p>
