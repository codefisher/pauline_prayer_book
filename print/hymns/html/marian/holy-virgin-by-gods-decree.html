    1. Holy Virgin by God’s decree
    You were called eternally;
    That he could give his Son to our race.
    Mary, we praise you, hail full of grace.
    Ave, Ave, Ave Maria

    2. By your faith and loving accord,
    As the handmaid of the Lord,
    You undertook God’s plan to embrace.
    Mary, we thank you, hail full of grace.
    Ave, Ave, Ave Maria

    3. Refuge for your children so weak,
    Sure protection all can seek.
    Problems of life you help us to face.
    Mary, we trust you, hail full of grace.
    Ave, Ave, Ave Maria

    4. To our needy world of today
    Love and beauty, you portray,
    Showing the path to Christ we must trace.
    Mary, our mother, hail full of grace.
    Ave, Ave, Ave Maria
