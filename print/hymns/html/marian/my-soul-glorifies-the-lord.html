<hymn title="My Soul Glorifies the Lord (Magnificat &ndash; English)" author="Gelineau">
    Refrain:
    The Lord has done marvels for me, Holy is His Name.

    My soul glorifies the Lord.
    My spirit rejoices in God, my Saviour.

    He looks on His servant in her nothingness;
    Henceforth: all generations will call me blessed.
    Refrain

    The Almighty works marvels for me, holy is his Name.
    His mercy is from age to age on those who fear Him.
    Refrain

    He puts forth His arm in strength and scatters the proud hearted.
    He casts the mighty from their thrones, and He raises the lowly.
    Refrain

    He fills the starving with good things: sends the rich away empty.
    He protects Israel His servant, remembering His mercy.
    Refrain

    The mercy promised to our fathers, for Abraham and his sons for ever.
    Praise the Father, the Son: and Holy Spirit both now and forever, world without end.
    Refrain
