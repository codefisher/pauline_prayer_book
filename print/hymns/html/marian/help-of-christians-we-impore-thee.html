<hymn title="Help of Christians, We Implore Thee" author="Beethoven Hymn to Joy, Words 1953 Hymn society of USA">
    1. Help of Christians, we implore thee aid thy children here below.
    Midst the dangers that surround us thou a motherâ€™s love canst show.
    Turn thine eyes of mercy towards us; to our humble prayer attend.
    In our daily toils and combats, strengthen, comfort and defend.

    2. Help of Christians, chosen Patron of this fair Australian land,
    Plant therein thy favourite virtues; train for God a loyal band.
    See us kneeling here before thee, From this vale of tears we sigh;
    Keep us now and guard us ever. Help, oh help us when we die.
