<hymn title="Praise to Mary of all Creatures the Loveliest"
      author="Alfonso M. de Liguori">
    1. Raise your voices vales and mountains
    Flow'ry meadows, streams and fountains
    Praise O praise the loveliest maiden
    Ever the Creator made

    Refrain:
    Laudate Laudate Laudate Mariam
    Laudate Laudate Laudate Mariam

    2. Murm'ring brooks your tribute bringing
    Little birds with joyful singing
    Come with mirthful praises laden
    To your Queen be homage paid
    Refrain

    3. Say sweet Virgin we implore thee
    Say what beauty God sheds o’er thee
    Praise and thanks to Him be given
    Who in love created thee
    Refrain

    4. Like a sun with splendour glowing
    Gleams thy heart with love o’erflowing
    Like the moon in starry heaven
    Shines thy peerless purity
    Refrain

    5. Like the rose and lily blooming
    Sweetly heaven and earth perfuming
    Stainless, spotless thou appearest
    Queenly beauty graces thee
    Refrain

    6. But to God in whom thou livest
    Sweeter joy and praise thou givest
    When to him in beauty nearest
    Yet so humble thou canst be
    Refrain

    7. Lovely maid to God most pleasing
    And for us His wrath appeasing
    Oh, by all thy love of Jesus
    Show to us thy clemency
    Refrain
