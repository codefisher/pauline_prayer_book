<hymn title="Holy Mary Full of Grace" author="A. Decha">
    1. When creation was begun
    God had chosen you to be
    Mother of his blessed Son
    Holy Mary full of grace; Ave, Ave, Ave Maria.

    2. When creation was restored
    You were there beside the Lord
    Whom you cherished and adored
    Holy Mary full of grace; Ave, Ave, Ave Maria.

    3. All of us are children too
    Often doubtful what to do
    Needing to confide in you
    Holy Mary full of grace; Ave, Ave, Ave Maria.

    4. You are with us day by day
    In our joys and our dismay
    Make us joyful as we say
    Holy Mary full of grace; Ave, Ave, Ave Maria.

    5. Lady take us by surprise
    Dazzle our unseeing eyes
    Show us where true beauty lies
    Holy Mary full of grace; Ave, Ave, Ave Maria.
