<h1 class="index">Act of Faith in Jesus Present in the Blessed Sacrament</h1>

<p>(Extract from “Credo of the People of God” ~ Pope Paul VI)</p>

<p>“We believe / that as the bread and wine / consecrated by the Lord at the Last Supper / were changed into His Body
    and Blood / which were to be offered for us on the Cross / likewise the bread and wine consecrated by the priest /
    are changed into the Body and Blood of Christ / enthroned gloriously in Heaven / and we believe / that the
    mysterious presence of the Lord / under what continues to appear to our senses as before / is a true, real and
    substantial presence.
</p>
<p>We believe / that ‘the reality of the bread’ / is changed into the Body of Christ / and the ‘reality of the wine’ /
    is changed into His Blood / leaving unchanged only the properties of the bread and wine / which our senses perceive.
</p>
<p>We believe / that ‘independently of our mind / the bread and wine have ceased to exist / after the Consecration / so
    that it is the adorable Body and Blood of the Lord Jesus / that from then on are really before us under the
    Sacramental species of bread and wine.’
</p>
<p>We believe / that ‘the unique and invisible existence of the Lord / glorious in Heaven / is not multiplied / but is
    rendered present by the Sacrament / in the many places on earth / where Mass is celebrated.’
</p>
<p>We believe / that ‘this existence remains present / after the Sacrifice / in the Blessed Sacrament / which is in the
    Tabernacle, / the living heart of each of our churches.’
