<hymn title="Immaculate Mary"
      author="Anonymous">
    1. Immaculate Mary, our hearts are on fire,
    That title so wond’rous fills all our desire.

    Refrain:
    Ave, Ave, Ave, Maria;
    Ave, Ave, Ave, Maria.

    2. We pray for God’s glory, may His kingdom come,
    We pray for His Vicar, our Father in Rome.

    3. We pray for our Mother, the Church upon earth,
    And bless, dearest Lady, the land of our birth.

    4. We pray for all sinners, and souls that now stray
    From Jesus and Mary in heresy’s way.

    5. For poor, sick, afflicted, thy mercy we crave,
    And comfort the dying, thou light of the grave.

    6. In grief and temptation, in joy or in pain,
    We’ll seek thee, our Mother, nor seek thee in vain.

    7. In death’s solemn moment, our Mother, be nigh,
    As children of Mary, O teach us to die.

    8. And crown thy sweet mercy with this special grace,
    To behold soon in heaven, God’s ravishing face.
