<hymn title="Star of Ocean, Lead Us" author="Anonymous 9th c." columns="columns">
    1. Star of Ocean, lead us;
    God for mother claims thee,
    Ever-Virgin names thee;
    Gate of heaven speed us.

    2. “Ave” to thee crying,
    Gabriel went before us;
    Peace do thou restore us;
    Eva’s knot untying.

    3. Loose the bonds that chain us,
    Darkened eyes enlighten,
    Clouded prospects brighten,
    Heav’nly mercies gain us.

    4. For thy sons thou carest;
    Offer Christ our praying &mdash;
    Still the word obeying &mdash;
    Whom on earth thou barest.

    5. Purer, kinder, maiden
    God did never fashion;
    Goodness and compassion
    Grant to hearts sin-laden.

    6. From that sin release us,
    Shield us, heavenward faring; &mdash;
    Heaven, that is but sharing
    In thy joy with Jesus.

    7. Honour, praise and merit
    To our God address we;
    Three in One confess we,
    Father, Son and Spirit.
