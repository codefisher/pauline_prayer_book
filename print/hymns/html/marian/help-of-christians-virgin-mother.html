<hymn title="Help of Christians, Virgin Mother">
    1. Help of Christians, Virgin Mother You alone the chosen one.
    By your fiat, you accepted Motherhood of God’s own Son.
    Through His grace &ndash; He came among us, Holy is His mighty name.
    Blessed are you among us all and through all ages will remain.

    2. Help of Christians, racked by sorrow when your Son was crucified.
    Seeing Him in torment suffer when for love of us He died.
    From the cross, He gave you to us as a caring mother, too.
    When our lives are touched by sorrow, then we share our pain with you.

    3. Help of Christians, gentle Mary, we are God’s new chosen race.
    On our journey, to our homeland, make us worthy of this grace.
    Help us serve the Lord in gladness mindful of this boundless love
    Til the day, when we’re united in our heavenly home above.

    4. Help of Christians, we the privileged living in this glorious land,
    Lavishly endowed with beauty fashioned by the Master’s hand.
    Mary, Patroness, we pray you help us live in harmony
    ‘Neath the Southern Cross we hail you: “Keep our nation always free.”
