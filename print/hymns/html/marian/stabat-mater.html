    1. By the Cross her vigil keeping,
    Stands the Queen of sorrows weeping,
    While her Son in torment hangs;

    2. Now she feels &mdash; O heart afflicted,
    By the sword of old predicted!
    More than all a mother’s pangs.,

    3. Sad and heavy stands beside Him
    She who once had magnified Him
    One-begotten, only-born.

    4. While she sees that rich atoning,
    Long the moaning, deep the groaning
    Of her mother-heart forlorn.

    5. Who, Christ’s Mother contemplating
    In such bitter anguish waiting,
    Had no human tears to shed?

    6. Who would leave Christ’s Mother, sharing
    All the pain her Son is bearing,
    By those tears uncomforted?

    7. Victim-priest or Jewry’s nation,
    There He hangs in expiation;
    Scourge and nail have had their will;

    8. Earth and heaven His cause forsaking,
    Now His noble heart is breaking;
    Now the labouring breath is still.

    9. Mother fount whence love flows truest!
    Let me know the pain thou knewest,
    Let me weep as thou hast wept;

    10. Love divine within me burning,
    That diviner love returning,
    May thy Son this heart accept.

    11. Mother, if my prayer be granted,
    Those five wounds of His implanted
    In my breast I fain would see;

    12. Love exceeding hangs there bleeding,
    My cause pleading, my love needing&mdash;,
    Bid Him share His cross with me.

    13. Til life fails, I would not fail Him,
    Still remember, still bewail Him,
    Born thy Son, and crucified.

    14. By the Cross, my vigil keeping
    I would spend those hours of weeping,
    Queen of Sorrows, at Thy side.

    15. When my body lies forsaken
    Let my ransomed soul awaken
    Safe in Paradise with Thee.
