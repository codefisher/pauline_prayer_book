<hymn title="Come to the Water"
      author="Frank Andersen">
    Refrain:
    Come to the water! You who are thirsty!
    Though you have nothing, I bid you come!
    And be filled with the goodness I have to offer!
    Come! Listen! Live.

    1. Why spend your money on what cannot fill
    The emptiness deep in your heart?
    Listen to My word and you will enjoy
    Goodness and peace in your heart!
    Refrain

    2. Just as the heavens are high above earth;
    My ways and thoughts beyond you!
    Call me your Father and know I am near!
    I will be Father to you!
    Refrain

    3. Just as the rain falls to water the earth;
    Just as a seed becomes bread
    My word upon you can never return
    Until My longing is filled!
    Refrain
