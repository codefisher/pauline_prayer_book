    Father, we praise you, We your trusting people;
    Father, we thank you, ruler and creator, giver of all our joy.

    we come to give thanks to you and praise you.

    2. Send forth the light of your truth to be our guide,
    and show us the way to our eternal home.

    3. Lord, we are sinners, unworthy of your love,
    and you are the Father who can pardon us.

    remember us, pray for us before his throne.
