<hymn title="As Gentle as Silence (Oh, The Love of My Lord Is the Essence)"
      author="Estelle White">
    1. Oh, the love of my Lord is the essence
    Of all that I love here on earth.
    All the beauty I see he has given to me,
    And His giving is gentle as silence.

    2.Every day, every hour, every moment
    Has been blessed by the strength of His love.
    At the turn of each tide He is there at my side,
    And his touch is as gentle as silence.

    3. There’ve been times when I’ve turned from his presence,
    And I’ve walked other paths, other ways.
    But I’ve called on his name in the dark of my shame,
    And His mercy was gentle as silence.
