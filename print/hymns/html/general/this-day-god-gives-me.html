<hymn title="This Day God Gives Me"
      author="St. Patrickâ€™s Breastplate, James Quinn, S.J. 1919- ">
    1. This day God gives me
    Strength of high heaven,
    Sun and moon shining,
    Flame in my hearth,
    Flashing of lightning,
    Wind in its swiftness,
    Deeps of the ocean,
    Firmness of earth.

    2. This day God sends me
    Strength to sustain me,
    Might to uphold me,
    Wisdom as guide.
    Your eyes are watchful,
    Your ears are list'ning,
    Your lips are speaking,
    Friend at my side.

    3. God's way is my way,
    God's shield is round me,
    God's host defends me,
    Saving from ill.
    Angels of heaven,
    Drive from me always
    All that would harm me,
    Stand by me still.

    4. Rising, I thank you,
    Mighty and strong One,
    King of creation,
    Giver of rest,
    Firmly confessing
    Threeness of Persons,
    Oneness of Godhead,
    Trinity blest.
