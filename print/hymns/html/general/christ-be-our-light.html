<hymn title="Christ Be Our Light"
      author="Bernadette Farrell - 1993">
    1. Longing for light, we wait in darkness.
    Longing for truth, we turn to you.
    Make us your own, your holy people,
    Light for the world to see.

    Refrain: Christ, be our light! Shine in our hearts.
    Shine through the darkness.
    Christ, be our light!
    Shine in your church gathered today.

    2. Longing for peace, our world is troubled.
    Longing for hope, many despair.
    Your word alone has powâ€™r to save us.
    Make us your living voice.
    Refrain

    3. Longing for food, many are hungry.
    Longing for water, many still thirst.
    Make us your bread, broken for others,
    Shared until all are fed.
    Refrain

    4. Longing for shelter, many are homeless.
    Longing for warmth, many are cold.
    Make us your building, sheltering others,
    Walls made of living stone.
    Refrain

    5. Many the gifts, many the people,
    Many the hearts that yearn to belong.
    Let us be servants to one another,
    Making your kingdom come.
    Refrain
