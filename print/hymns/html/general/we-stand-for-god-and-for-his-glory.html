<hymn title="We Stand for God! And For His Glory"
      author="J.P. O'Daly OP">
    1. We stand for God and for His glory,
    The Lord supreme and God of all;
    Against His foes we raise His standard;
    Around the cross we hear his call.

    Refrain:
    Strengthen our faith, Redeemer;
    Guard us when danger is nigh;
    To thee we pledge our lives and service,
    For God we live , for God we’ll die:
    To thee we pledge our lives and service,
    For God we live, for God we die.

    2. We stand for God! Jesus our master
    Has died for us with love untold;
    His law divine and truth unchanging
    In this our land their place must hold.
    Refrain

    3. We stand for God! in ages olden
    He placed “the Cross” our stars beside;
    O may our land, gracious and golden,
    Be faithful to the Crucified.
    Refrain
