    Refrain:
    In faith and hope and love
    With joyful trust we move
    Towards our Father's home above.

    1. Christ, our star, our map, our road
    To the Father's high abode.
    Refrain

    2. Christ, our bread along the way;
    Christ, our rescue when we stray.
    Refrain

    3. Christ, our shelter, Christ our friend,
    Our beginning and our end.
    Refrain

    4. Christ, our hope and our reward;
    Our redeemer and our Lord.
    Refrain
