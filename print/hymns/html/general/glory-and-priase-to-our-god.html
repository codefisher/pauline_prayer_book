<hymn title="Glory and Praise to Our God"
      author="Dan Schutte, 1947-">
    Refrain:
    Glory and praise to our God,
    Who alone gives light to our days.
    Many are the blessings He bears,
    To those who trust in His ways.

    1. We the daughters and sons of Him,
    Who built the valleys and plains.
    Praise the wonders our God has done,
    In every heart that sings.
    Refrain

    2. In His wisdom He strengthens us,
    Like gold that's tested in fire.
    Though the power of sin prevails,
    Our God is there to save.
    Refrain

    3. Every moment of every day,
    Our God is waiting to save.
    Always ready to seek the lost,
    To answer those who pray.
    Refrain

    4. God has watered our barren land
    And spent His merciful rain.
    Now the rivers of life run full
    For anyone to drink.
    Refrain
