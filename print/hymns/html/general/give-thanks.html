    Give thanks with a grateful heart,
    Give thanks to the Holy One,
    Give thanks because he has given Jesus Christ His Son.
    Give thanks with a grateful heart,
    Give thanks to the Holy One,

    1. And now let the weak say "I am strong"
    Let the poor say, "I am rich"
    Because of what the Lord has done for us.
    And now let the weak say "I am strong"
    Let the poor say, "I am rich"
    Because of what the Lord has done for us.
