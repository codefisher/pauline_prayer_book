<hymn title="We Walk by Faith"
      author="Henry Alford, 1810-1871">
    1. We walk by faith, and not by sight:
    No gracious words we hear
    Of him who spoke as none e'er spoke,
    But we believe Him near.

    2. We may not touch His hands and side,
    Nor follow where He trod;
    Yet in His promise we rejoice,
    And cry, "My Lord and God!"

    3. Help then, O Lord, our unbelief,
    And may our faith abound;
    To call on You when You are near.
    And seek where You are found:

    4. That when our life of faith is done
    In realms of clearer light
    We may behold You as You are
    In full and endless sight.

    5. We walk by faith, and not by sight:
    No gracious words we hear
    Of Him who spoke as none e'er spoke,
    But we believe Him near.
