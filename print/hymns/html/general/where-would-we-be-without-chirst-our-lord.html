<hymn title="Where Would We Be Without Christ Our Lord"
      author="Michael Cockett">
    1. Where would we be without Christ our Lord:
    We would be lost and walking in darkness.
    He is the lantern and lights up the darkness,
    And He is the shepherd who finds the right path.

    Refrain:
    So let the trumpet sound to the glory of God.
    He is our Lord, loving and wise.

    2. Where would we be without Christ our Lord?
    We would be left to wander the desert.
    He is the beacon that leads us to safety,
    And He is the water that brings us new life.
    Refrain

    3. Where would we be without Christ our Lord?
    We would be cold and starving and thirsty.
    He is the bread that is food for the spirit,
    And He is the wine of the new covenant.
    Refrain

    4. Where would we be without Christ our Lord?
    He is the Son who saves all the nations.
    Through Christ the Son, we are given the Spirit,
    And this is the Spirit who brings us new life.
    Refrain
