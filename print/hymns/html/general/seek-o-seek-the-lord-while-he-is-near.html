<hymn title="Seek, O Seek The Lord, While He is Near"
      author="James McAuley, 1917-1976; tune Richard Connolly, 1927-">
    Refrain:
    Seek, O seek the Lord, while He is near;
    Trust Him, speak to Him in prayer, and He will hear.

    1. God be with us in our lives,
    Direct us in our calling;
    Break the snares the world contrives,
    Keep us from falling.
    Refrain

    2. God, increase in us the life
    That Christ by dying gave us.
    Though we faint with mortal strife,
    His blood will save us.
    Refrain

    3. Strengthen in our hearts the love
    We owe to one another.
    How can we love God above
    And not our brother?
    Refrain
