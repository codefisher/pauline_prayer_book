<hymn title="Now Thank We All Our God"
      author="M. Rinkart 1586-1649; Trans. C. Winkworth 1829-78">
    1. Now thank we all our God,
    With heart and hands and voices,
    Who wond’rous things hath done,
    In whom this world rejoices;
    Who from our mother’s arms
    Has blessed us on our way
    With countless gifts of love,
    And still is ours today.

    2. Oh, may this bounteous God
    Through all our lives be near us,
    With ever joyful hearts
    And blessed peace to cheer us;
    And keep us in His grace,
    And guide us when perplexed,
    And free us from all ills
    In this world and the next.

    3. All praise and thanks to God
    The Father now be given,
    The Son, and Him who reigns
    With them in highest Heaven,
    The one eternal God,
    Whom earth and Heaven adore;
    For thus it was, is now,
    And shall be ever more.
