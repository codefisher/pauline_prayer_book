<hymn title="I Love Thee, O Thou Lord Most High"
      author="Latin hymn, ca. 1695; paraphrase of St. Ignatius of Loyola (1491 -1556); Tr. Fr. Edward Caswall, 1858, alt.">
    1. I love Thee, O Thou Lord most high!
    Because Thou first hast loved me;
    I seek no other liberty
    Than that of being bound to Thee.

    2. May memory no thought suggest,
    But shall to Thy pure glory tend;
    My understanding find no rest
    Except in Thee, its only end.


    3. All mine is Thine, &mdash;say but the word,
    Whateâ€™er Thou willest shall be done;
    I know Thy love, all-gracious Lord;
    I know it seeks my good alone.

    4. Apart from Thee all things are naught;
    Then grant, O my supremest bliss!
    Grant me to love Thee as I ought;&mdash;
    Thou givest all in giving this!
