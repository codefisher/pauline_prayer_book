<hymn title="Peace, I Leave With You, My Friends"
      author="Ray Repp 1966">
    Refrain:
    Peace I leave with you, my friends:
    Shalom my peace, in all you do.
    Peace I leave with you, my friends,
    I give to you, so you can give to others, too.

    1. To share His love is why I came,
    To show His kindness to all men.
    Go now my friends and do the same,
    Until I come again&hellip;
    Refrain

    2. Take my hand and be at peace,
    The spirit of our love I send;
    And with this love you will be free,
    Until I come again&hellip;
    Refrain

    3. With this love, all men will know,
    That loneliness is at an end,
    Rejoice my brothers, though I go
    For I will come again&hellip;
    Refrain
