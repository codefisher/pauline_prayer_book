<hymn title="For Australia (Lord of Earth and All Creation)"
      author="Words, Mr Thwaites, music R Boughen">
    1. Lord of earth and all creation,
    Let your love possess our land:
    Wealth, and freedom, far horizons,
    Mountain, forest, shining sand:
    May we share, in faith and friendship,
    Gifts unmeasured from your hand.

    2. People of the ancient Dreamtime,
    They who found this country first,
    Ask with those, the later comers,
    Will our dream be blessed or cursed?
    Grant us, Lord, new birth, new living,
    Hope for which our children thirst.

    3. Lord, life-giving healing Spirit,
    On our hurts your mercy shower;
    Lead us by your inward dwelling,
    Guiding, guarding, every hour.
    Bless and keep our land Australia:
    In your will her peace and power.
