<hymn title="Praise, My Soul, The King of Heaven"
      author="Henry Francis Lyte 1793-1847, Based On Psalm 102 (103)">
    1. Praise, my soul, the King of Heaven;
    To His feet thy tribute bring;
    Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven,
    Who like me His praise should sing?
    Praise Him, praise Him, alleluia,
    Praise the everlasting King!

    2. Praise Him for His grace and favour
    To our fathers in distress;
    Praise Him still the same for ever,
    Slow to chide, and swift to bless:
    Praise Him, praise Him, alleluia,
    Glorious in His faithfulness!

    3. Father-like He tends and spares us;
    Well our feeble frame He knows;
    In His hands He gently bears us,
    Rescues us from all our foes:
    Praise Him, praise Him, alleluia,
    Widely as His mercy flows!

    4. Angels, help us to adore Him,
    Ye behold Him face to face;
    Sun and moon, bow down before Him,
    Dwellers all in time and space:
    Praise Him, praise Him, alleluia,
    Praise with us the God of grace!
