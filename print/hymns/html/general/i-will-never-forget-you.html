<hymn title="I Will Never Forget You (Isaiah 49)"
      author="Carey Landry - Isaiah 49">
    1. I will never forget you, My people
    I have carved you on the palm of My hand
    I will never forget you
    I will not leave you orphaned
    I will never forget My own

    2. Does a mother forget her baby?
    Or a woman the child within her womb?
    Yet even if these forget,
    Yes, even if these forget,
    I will never forget my own
