    1. Seek ye first the kingdom of God
    And His righteousness;
    And all these things shall be added unto you.
    Alleluia, Alleluia!

    2. Ask, and it shall be given unto you;
    Seek, and you shall find.
    Knock, and it shall be opened unto you.
    Alleluia, Alleluia!

    3. Man shall not live by bread alone,
    But by every word
    That proceeds out from the mouth of God.
    Alleluia, Alleluia!
