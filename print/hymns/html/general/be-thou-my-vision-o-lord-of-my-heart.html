<hymn title="Be Thou My Vision, O Lord of My Heart" author="Trad. Irish 8th c.">
    1. Be Thou my vision, O Lord of my heart;
    Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art;
    Thou my best thought, by day or by night;
    Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.

    2. Be Thou my wisdom, and Thou my true Word;
    I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord;
    Thou my great Father and I, Thy true son;
    Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.

    3. Be thou my shield and my sword for the fight;
    Be thou my armour, and thou be my might:
    Thou art my soul’s shelter, and thou my high tower:
    Raise me thou heav’nward, O Power of my power.

    4. Riches I heed not, nor man’s empty praise;
    Thou mine inheritance, now and always;
    Thou and Thou only, first in my heart;
    High King of Heaven, my treasure Thou art.

    5. High king of heaven, keep thou ever whole
    Thy love in my heart, thy light in my soul;
    O light of my soul, from me never part,
    High king of heaven, O love of my heart.

    6. High King of heaven, when battle is done
    Grant heaven’s joy to me, bright heaven’s Sun;
    O Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,
    Still be my vision, O Ruler of all.
