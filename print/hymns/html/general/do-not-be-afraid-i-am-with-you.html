      author="Christopher Willcock SJ 197">
    Refrain:
    Do not be afraid, I am with you.
    I have called you by your name, you are mine.
    I have called you by your name, you are mine.

    1 . The Lord is my light and my help; whom shall I fear?
    The Lord is the stronghold of my life; before whom shall I shrink?
    Refrain

    2. There is one thing I asked of the Lord; for this I long:
    to live in the house of the Lord all the days of my life.
    Refrain

    3. I am sure I shall see the Lordâ€™s goodness in the land of the living.
    Hope in Him! Hold firm and take heart. Hope in the Lord.
    Refrain
