<hymn title="All People That on Earth Do Dwell"
      author="William Kethe †1608, As In Day’s Psalter 1561, Psalm 100">
    1. All people that on earth do dwell,
    Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice:
    Him serve with fear, His praise forth tell,
    Come ye before Him and rejoice.

    2. Know that the Lord is God indeed;
    Without our aid He did us make;
    We are His folk, He doth us feed,
    And for His sheep He doth us take.

    3. O enter then His gates with praise,
    Approach with joy His courts unto;
    Praise, laud, and bless his Name always,
    For it is seemly so to do.

    4. For why? The Lord our God is good,
    His mercy is for ever sure;
    His truth at all times firmly stood,
    And shall from age to age endure.

    5. To Father, Son and Holy Ghost,
    The God whom Heav’n and earth adore;
    From men and from the angel host,
    Be praise and glory evermore.
