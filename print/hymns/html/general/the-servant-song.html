<hymn title="The Servant Song"
      author="Richard Gillard, 1953-">
    1. Will you let me be your servant
    Let me be as Christ to you
    Pray that I might have the grace
    To let you be my servant too.

    2. We are pilgrims on a journey
    We are brothers on the road
    We are here to help each other
    Walk the mile and bear the load.

    3. I will hold the Christ light for you
    In the night time of your fear
    I will hold my hand out to you
    Speak the peace you long to hear.

    4. I will weep when you are weeping
    When you laugh, I’ll laugh with you
    I will share your joy and sorrow
    Till we’ve seen this journey through.

    5. When we sing to God in heaven
    We shall find such harmony
    Born of all we’ve known together
    Of Christ’s love and agony.

    6. Will you let me be your servant
    Let me be as Christ to you
    Pray that I might have the grace
    To let you be my servant too.
