<hymn title="Only a Shadow"
      author="Rev. Carey Landry, 1971">
    1. The love, I have for You, my Lord,
    Is only a shadow of Your love for me;
    Only a shadow of Your love for me,
    Your deep, abiding love.

    2. My own belief in You, my Lord,
    Is only a shadow of Your faith in me;
    Only a shadow of Your faith in me,
    Your deep and lasting faith.

    Refrain:
    My life is in Your hands, My life is in Your hands.
    My love for You will grow, my God; Your light in me will shine.

    3. The dream I have today, my Lord,
    Is only a shadow of Your dreams for me,
    Only a shadow of all that will be,
    If I but follow You.

    4. The joy I feel today, my Lord,
    Is only a shadow of Your joys for me,
    Only a shadow of Your joys for me,
    When we meet face to face.
    Refrain
