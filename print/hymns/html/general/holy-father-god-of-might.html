<hymn title="Holy Father, God of Might"
      author="Richard Connolly, 1927-">
    1. Holy Father, God of might,
    Throned amid the hosts of light
    Take our life, our strength, our love,
    King of earth and heav'n above.

    2. Hear the songs your people raise,
    Songs of joyful thanks and praise,
    Calling all created things
    To adore you, King of kings.

    3. Christ, be with us as we go,
    Let this blind world see and know,
    Burning in our lives, the sight
    Of its only saving Light.

    4. So, all men will bless your name,
    And your kingship all proclaim,
    Praising, with the heav'nly host,
    Father, Son and Holy Ghost.
