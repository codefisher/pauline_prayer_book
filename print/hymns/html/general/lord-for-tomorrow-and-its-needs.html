<hymn title="Lord, For Tomorrow and Its Needs"
      author="Sybil F. Partridge">
    1. Lord, for tomorrow and its needs, I do not pray;
    Keep me, my God, from stain of sin just for today.

    2. Let me both diligently work, and duly pray.
    Let me be kind in word and deed, just for today.

    3. Let me be slow to do my will, prompt to obey;
    Help me to mortify my flesh, just for today.

    4. Let me no wrong or idle word unthinking say:
    set thou a seal upon my lips, just for today.

    5. And if today my tide of life should ebb away,
    Give me thy Sacraments divine, Sweet Lord today.

    6. So for tomorrow and its needs, I do not pray,
    But keep and guide me, love me, Lord, just for today.
