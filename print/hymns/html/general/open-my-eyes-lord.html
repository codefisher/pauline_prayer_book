    1. Open my eyes, Lord
    Help me to see your face
    Open my eyes, Lord
    Help me to see

    2. Open my ears, Lord
    Help me to hear your voice
    Open my ears, Lord
    Help me to hear

    3. Open my heart, Lord
    Help me to love like you
    Open my heart, Lord
    Help me to love

    4. I live within you
    Deep in your heart, O Love
    I live within you
    Rest now in me
