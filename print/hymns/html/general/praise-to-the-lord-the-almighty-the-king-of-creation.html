<hymn title="Praise to the Lord, the Almighty, the King of Creation"
      author="J. Neander 1650-">
    1. Praise to the Lord, the Almighty, the King of Creation!
    O my soul, praise Him, for He is your health and salvation.
    All you who hear, now to His altar draw near,
    Join in profound adoration.

    2. Praise to the Lord, let us offer our gifts at His altar;
    Let not our sins and transgressions now cause us to falter.
    Christ the High Priest bids us all join in His feast,
    Victims with Him on the altar.

    3. Praise to the Lord, who will prosper our work and defend us;
    Surely His goodness and mercy here daily attend us;
    Ponder anew all the Almighty can do,
    He who with love will befriend us.

    4. Praise to the Lord, oh, let all that is in us adore Him!
    All that has life and breath, come now in praises before Him.
    Let the Amen sound from His people again,
    Now as we worship before Him.
