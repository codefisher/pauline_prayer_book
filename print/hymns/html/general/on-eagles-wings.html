<hymn title="On Eagle's Wings"
      author="Michael Joncas">
    1. You who dwell in the shelter of the Lord
    Who abide in His shadow for life
    Say to the Lord: "My refuge,
    My rock in whom I trust!"
    Refrain

    Refrain:
    And He will raise you up on eagles' wings
    Bear you on the breath of dawn
    Make you to shine like the sun
    And hold you in the palm of His hand.

    2. The snare of the fowler will never capture you
    And famine will bring you no fear
    Under His wings your refuge
    His faithfulness your shield.
    Refrain

    3. You need not fear the terror of the night
    Nor the arrow that flies by day
    Though thousands fall about you
    Near you it shall not come.
    Refrain

    4. For to His angels He's given a command
    To guard you in all of your ways
    Upon their hands they will bear you up
    Lest you dash your foot against a stone.
    Refrain
