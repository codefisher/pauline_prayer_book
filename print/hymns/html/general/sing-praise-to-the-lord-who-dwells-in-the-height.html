<hymn title="Sing Praise to the Lord Who Dwells in the Height"
      author="Henry Williams. Baker (1875), 1821-1877">
    1. Sing praise to the Lord! Who dwells in the height;
    rejoice in His word, all angels of light;
    You heavens adore him by whom you were made,
    And worship before Him, in brightness arrayed.

    2. Sing praise to the Lord all people on earth!
    Delight to record His gift of new birth;
    Praise Him who has brought you His grace from above,
    Praise Him who has taught you to sing of His love.

    3. Sing praise to the Lord, all things that make sound!
    Each note and each chord re-echo around;
    Loud organs His glory announce with glad song,
    Soft harp tell the story of what He has done.

    4. Sing praise to the Lord! Give thanks with your voice;
    With perfect accord His people rejoice;
    For love of creation, for heaven restored,
    For grace of salvation, sing praise to the Lord!
