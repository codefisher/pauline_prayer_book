    My soul is longing for your peace, near to you my God.

    1. Lord, you know that my heart is not proud,
    And my eyes are not lifted from the earth
    Refrain

    2. Lofty thoughts have never filled my mind,
    Far beyond my sight all ambitious deeds.
    Refrain

    3. In your peace I have maintained my soul;
    I have kept my heart in your quiet peace.

    4. As a child rests on his motherâ€™s knee,
    So I place my soul in your loving care

    Place your trust in him, now and evermore.
