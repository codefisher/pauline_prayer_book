<hymn title="Be Still, My Soul"
      author="Catharina von Schlegel, 1697-? Translated by Jane Borthwick, 1813-1897">
    1. Be still, my soul; the Lord is on your side;
    Bear patiently the cross of grief or pain;
    Leave to your God to order and provide;
    In every change He faithful will remain.
    Be still, my soul; your best, your heavenly, Friend
    Through thorny ways leads to a joyful end.

    2. Be still, my soul; your God will undertake
    To guide the future as He has the past.
    Your hope, your confidence, let nothing shake;
    All now mysterious shall be clear at last.
    Be still, my soul; the tempests still obey
    His voice, who ruled them once on Galilee.

    3. Be still, my soul, when dearest friends depart
    And all is darkened in the vale of tears;
    Then you shall better know His love, His heart,
    Who comes to soothe your sorrow, calm your fears.
    Be still, my soul; for Jesus can repay
    From His own fulness all He takes away.

    4. Be still, my soul; the hour is hastening on
    When we shall be forever with the Lord,
    When disappointment, grief, and fear are gone,
    Sorrow forgotten loveâ€™s pure joy restored.
    Be still, my soul; when change and tears are past,
    All safe and blessed we shall meet at last.
