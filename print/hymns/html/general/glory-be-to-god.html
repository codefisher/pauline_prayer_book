<hymn title="Glory Be to God"
      author="Michael Perry 1982">
    1. Glory be to God in heaven,
    peace to those who love Him well;
    on the earth let all His people
    speak His grace, His wonders tell:
    Lord, we praise you for your glory,
    mighty Father, heaven's king;
    hear our joyful adoration
    and accept the thanks we bring.

    2. Only Son of God the Father,
    Lamb who takes our sin away,
    now with Him in triumph seated&mdash;
    for your mercy, Lord, we pray:
    Jesus Christ, most high and holy,
    Saviour, you are God alone
    in the glory of the Father
    with the Spirit: Three-in-One!
