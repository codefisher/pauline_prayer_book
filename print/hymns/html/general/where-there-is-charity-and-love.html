<hymn title="Where There is Charity and Love"
      author="Richard Connolly, 1927-">
    Refrain:
    Where there is charity and love,
    there the God of love abides.

    1. The love of Christ has gathered us as one,
    Rejoice in him with joy which He imparts;
    Let us revere and love the living God
    And love each other with unfeigning hearts.
    Refrain

    2. And so when we are gathered here as one,
    Let quarrels die and envious rancour cease;
    Be our resolve all bitterness to shun
    And in our midst be Christ, His love and peace.
    Refrain

    3. Oh, lead us, Master, by Your saving grace,
    To where the blessed glory in Your sight;
    There let us see and love You face to face,
    Gathered once more in everlasting light.
    Refrain
