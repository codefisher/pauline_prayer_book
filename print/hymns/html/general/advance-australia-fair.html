<hymn title="Advance Australia Fair" author="Peter Dodds Mc Cormack 1834-">
    1. Australians all let us rejoice,
    For we are young and free;
    We’ve golden soil and wealth for toil;
    Our home is girt by sea;
    Our land abounds in nature’s gifts
    Of beauty rich and rare;
    In history’s page, let every stage
    Advance Australia Fair.
    In joyful strains then let us sing,
    Advance Australia Fair.

    2. Beneath our radiant Southern Cross
    We’ll toil with hearts and hands;
    To make this Commonwealth of ours
    Renowned of all the lands;
    For those who’ve come across the seas
    We’ve boundless plains to share;
    With courage let us all combine
    To Advance Australia Fair.
    In joyful strains then let us sing,
    Advance Australia Fair.

    3. With Christ our head and cornerstone,
    We'll build our Nation's might,
    Whose way and truth and light alone,
    Can guide our path aright.
    Our lives, a sacrifice of love,
    Reflect our Master's care
    With faces turned to heaven above,
    Advance Australia fair.
    In joyful strains then let us sing,
    Advance Australia fair.
