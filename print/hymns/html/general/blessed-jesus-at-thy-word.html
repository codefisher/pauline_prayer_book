<hymn title="Blessed Jesus, At Thy Word"
      author="Tobias Clausnitzer 1619-84; Trans. Catherine Winkworth 1827-78">
    1. Blessed Jesus, at Thy word
    We are gathered all to hear Thee;
    Let our hearts and souls be stirred
    Now to seek and love and fear Thee,
    By Thy teachings, sweet and holy,
    Drawn from earth to love Thee solely.

    2. All our knowledge, sense and sight
    Lie in deepest darkness shrouded,
    Till your spirit breaks our night
    With your beams of truth unclouded;
    You alone to God can win us;
    You must work all good within us.

    3. Glorious Lord, Thyself impart,
    Light of Light, from God proceeding;
    Open Thou our ears and heart,
    Help us by Thy Spiritâ€™s pleading;
    Hear the cry Thy people raises,
    Hear and bless our prayers and praises.
