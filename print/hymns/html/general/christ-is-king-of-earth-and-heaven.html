<hymn title="Christ Is King of Earth And Heaven"
      author="Ivor J. E. Daniel">
    1. Christ is King of earth and heaven!
    Let his subjects all proclaim,
    In the splendour of his temple,
    Honour to his holy name.

    2. Christ is King! No soul created
    Can refuse to bend the knee,
    To the God made man who reigneth
    As â€˜twas promised, from the tree.

    3. Christ is King! Let humble sorrow
    For our past neglect atone,
    For the lack of faithful service
    To the Master whom we own.


    4. Christ is King! Let joy and gladness
    Greet him; let his courts resound
    With the praise of faithful subjects
    To his love in honour bound.

    5. Christ is king! In health and sickness,
    Till we breathe our dying breath,
    Till we greet in highest heaven,
    Christ the victor over death.
