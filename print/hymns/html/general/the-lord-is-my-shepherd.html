<hymn title="The Lord is My Shepherd"
      author="Brian Boniwell, 1949-(1981)">
    1. The Lord is my Shepherd, and I want to follow,
    Wherever He leads me, wherever He goes.
    Over the mountains, the waters and by-ways,
    Valleys and highways He’s waiting for me.

    Refrain:
    I want to go to meet Him there,
    To lay myself down in His love.
    The Lord is my shepherd, and I want to follow,
    Wherever He leads me, wherever He goes.

    2. And while on the journey to where we are going,
    He promised to be there to help us along.
    And over the mountains we’ll walk on together,
    To know all the wonders He’s given to me.
    Refrain
