<hymn title="Lord, To Whom Shall We Go?"
      author="Br. Michael Herry">
    Refrain:
    Lord, to whom shall we go? You are our bread, broken and shared,
    Lord, to whom shall we go? Yours are the words of life

    1. Our fathers ate, yet their hunger remained.
    Their hearts were not satisfied.
    Refrain

    2. O Lord, you feed us with the finest of wheat,
    Our pledge of eternal life.
    Refrain

    3. The bread you give is the living bread,
    Your flesh for the life of the world.
    Refrain

    4. Your word, O Lord, is a lamp for my steps;
    A light for my path of life.
    Refrain
