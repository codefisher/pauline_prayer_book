<hymn title="See Us, Lord, About Thine Altar"
      author="J Greally SJ, 1934">
    1. See us, Lord about Thine altar,
    Though so many we are one;
    Many souls by love united
    In the heart of Christ, Thy Son.

    2. Hear our prayers, O loving Father,
    Hear in them Thy Son our Lord;
    Hear him speak our love and worship
    As we sing with one accord.

    3. Wheat and grape contain the meaning:
    Food and drink He is to all;
    One in Him, we kneel adoring,
    Gathered by His loving call.

    4. Hear us yet: so much is needful
    In our frail, disordered life;
    Stay with us and tend our weakness
    Til that day of no more strife.

    5. Members of his Mystic Body
    Now we know our prayer is heard,
    Heard by Thee, because Thy children
    Have received the Eternal Word.
