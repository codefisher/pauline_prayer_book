<hymn title="The Hound of Heaven (How Rich Are the Depths of God)"
      author="Christopher Willcock SJ 1991.">
    Refrain:
    How rich are the depths of God.
    How deep Godâ€™s wisdom and knowledge,
    Whose ways we do not know.

    1. O Lord you search me and you know me,
    You know my resting and my rising,
    You discern my purpose from afar.
    All my ways lie open to you.
    Refrain

    2. It was you who created my being,
    Knit me together in the womb.
    I thank you, Lord for my being,
    For the wonder of all your creation.
    Refrain

    3. O search me, God and know my spirit,
    O test me and know my thoughts;
    O make me not walk in evil,
    But lead me in the way of truth.
    Refrain
