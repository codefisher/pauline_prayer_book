<hymn title="Hail, Redeemer, King Divine!"
      author="Patrick Brennan CSsR, 1877-1952">
    1. Hail Redeemer, King divine!
    Priest and Lamb, the throne is thine; 
    King, whose reign shall never cease,
    Prince of everlasting peace.

    Refrain:
    Angels, saints and nations sing: 
    &ldquo;Praise be Jesus Christ our King; 
    Lord of life, earth, sky and sea, 
    King of love on Calvary!&rdquo;

    2. King, whose name creation thrills,
    rule our hearts, our minds, our wills; 
    till in peace, each nation rings 
    with thy praises, King of kings. 
    Refrain

    3. King most holy, King of truth, 
    guard the lowly, guide the youth;
    Christ the King of glory bright,
    be to us eternal light. 
    Refrain

    4. Shepherd-king, o'er mountains steep
    homeward bring the wandering sheep; 
    shelter in one royal fold
    states and kingdoms, new and old.
    Refrain
