<hymn title="Help, Lord, The Souls That Thou Hast Made (Holy Souls)"
      author="Newman 1801-90">
    1. Help, Lord, the souls that Thou hast made,
    The souls to Thee so dear,
    In prison for the debt unpaid
    Of sin committed here.

    2. These holy souls, they suffer on,
    Resignâ€™d in heart and will,
    Until Thy high behest is done,
    And justice has its fill.

    3. Oh, by their patience of delay,
    Their hope amid their pain,
    Their sacred zeal to burn away
    Disfigurement and stain;

    4. Oh, by their fire of love, not less
    In keenness than the flame;
    Oh, by their very helplessness,
    Oh, by Thy own great Name;

    5. Good Jesu, help! sweet Jesu, aid
    The souls to Thee most dear,
    In prison for the debt unpaid
    Of sins committed here.
