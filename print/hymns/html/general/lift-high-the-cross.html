    Refrain:
    Lift high the cross, the love of Christ proclaim,
    Til all the world adore His sacred name.

    1. Come people, follow where our Captain trod
    Our King victorious, Christ the Son of God:
    Refrain

    2. Led on their way by this triumphant sign,
    The hosts of God in conquering ranks combine:
    Refrain

    3. Each newborn servant of the Crucified
    Bears on his brow the seal of Him who died:
    Refrain

    4. From north and south, from east and west they raise
    in growing unison their song of praise:
    Refrain

    5. O Lord, once lifted on the glorious tree,
    As Thou hast promised, draw the world to Thee:
    Refrain

    6. From farthest regions let them homage bring,
    and on his cross, adore their Saviour King:
    Refrain

    7. So shall our song of triumph ever be:
    “Praise to the Crucified for victory.”
    Refrain
