      author="Anonymous">
    1. Peace is flowing like a river,
    Flowing out from you and me,
    Spreading out into the desert,
    Setting all the captives free.

    2. Joy is flowing like a river,
    Flowing out from you and me,
    Spreading out into the desert,
    Setting all the captives free.

    3. Love is flowing like a river,
    Flowing out from you and me,
    Spreading out into the desert,
    Setting all the captives free.

    4. Hope is flowing like a river,
    Flowing out from you and me,
    Spreading out into the desert,
    Setting all the captives free.

    5. Peace is flowing like a river,
    Flowing out from you and me,
    Spreading out into the desert,
    Setting all the captives free.
