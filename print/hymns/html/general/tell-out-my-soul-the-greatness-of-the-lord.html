<hymn title="Tell Out, My Soul, The Greatness of the Lord"
      author="Timothy Dudley-Smith, 1926- (based on Magnificat)">
    1. Tell out, my soul, the greatness of the Lord!
    Unnumbered blessings give my spirit voice;
    Tender to me the promise of His word;
    In God my Saviour shall my heart rejoice.

    2. Tell out, my soul, the greatness of His Name!
    Make known His might, the deeds His arm has done;
    His mercy sure, from age to age the same;
    His holy Name&mdash;the Lord, the Mighty One.

    3. Tell out, my soul, the greatness of His might!
    Powers and dominions lay their glory by.
    Proud hearts and stubborn wills are put to flight,
    The hungry fed, the humble lifted high.

    4. Tell out, my soul, the glories of His word!
    Firm is His promise, and His mercy sure.
    Tell out, my soul, the greatness of the Lord
    to children's children and for evermore!
