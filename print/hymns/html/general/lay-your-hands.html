<hymn title="Lay Your Hands"
      author="Carey Landry">
    Refrain:
    Lay your hands gently upon us
    Let their touch render your peace
    Let them bring your forgiveness and healing
    Lay your hands gently lay your hands

    1. You were sent to free the broken hearted
    You were sent to give sight to the blind
    You desire to heal all our illness
    Lay your hands gently lay your hands.
    Refrain

    2. Lord we come to You through one another
    Lord we come to You in our need
    Lord we come to You seeking wholeness
    Lay your hands gently lay your hands
    Refrain
</hymn>
