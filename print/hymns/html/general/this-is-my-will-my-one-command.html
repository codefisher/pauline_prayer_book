      author="James Quinn, S.J. 1919- (John 15:12-17)">
    1. This is my will, my one command,
    That love should dwell among you all.
    This is my will, that you should love
    As I have shown that I love you.

    2. No greater love a man can have
    Than that he die to save his friends.
    You are my friends if you obey
    What I command that you should do.

    3. I call you now no longer slaves;
    No slave knows all the master does.
    I call you friends, for all I hear
    My Father say, you hear from me.

    4. You chose not me, but I chose you,
    That you should go and bear much fruit.
    I chose you out that you in me
    Should bear much fruit that will abide.

    5. All that you ask my Father dear
    For my name's sake, you shall receive.
    This is my will, my one command,
    That love should dwell in each, in all.
