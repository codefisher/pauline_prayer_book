<hymn title="The King of Love My Shepherd Is"
      author="Henry William Baker, 1821-1877.  Psalm 22 (23)">
    1. The King of love my Shepherd is,
    Whose goodness faileth never;
    I nothing lack if I am His
    And He is mine forever.

    2. Where streams of living water flow
    My ransomed soul He leadeth,
    And where the verdant pastures grow,
    With food celestial feedeth.

    3. Perverse and foolish oft I strayed,
    But yet in love He sought me,
    And on His shoulder gently laid,
    And home rejoicing brought me.

    4. In death’s dark vale, I fear no ill
    With Thee, dear Lord, beside me;
    Thy rod and staff my comfort still,
    Thy cross before to guide me.

    5. Thou spread’st a table in my sight;
    Thy holy grace bestowing;
    And oh! what comfort and delight,
    My chalice now o’er flowing.

    6. And so through all the length of days
    Thy goodness faileth never;
    Good Shepherd, may I sing Thy praise
    Within Thy house forever.
