    1. Peace before us, peace behind us, peace under our feet.
    Peace within us, peace over us, let all around us be peace.

    Love within us, love over us, let all around us be love.

    3. Light before us, light behind us, light under our feet.
    Light within us, light over us, let all around us be light.

    4. Christ before us, Christ behind us, Christ under our feet.
    Christ within us, Christ over us, let all around us be Christ.

    5. Alleluia. Alleluia. Alleluia. Alleluia. Alleluia. Alleluia.

    6. Peace before us, peace behind us, peace under our feet.
    Peace within us, peace over us, let all around us be peace.
