<hymn title="Gather Your People, O Lord"
      author="Bob Hurd 1991.">
    Refrain:
    Gather your people, O Lord.
    Gather your people, O Lord.
    One bread, one body, one spirit of love.
    Gather your people, O Lord.

    1. Draw us forth to the table of life:
    Brothers and sisters,
    Each of us called to walk in your light.
    Refrain

    2. We are parts of the body of Christ,
    Needing each other,
    Each of the gifts the Spirit provides.
    Refrain

    3. No more harm on the mountain of God;
    Swords into plowshares.
    Free us, O Lord, from hardness of heart.
    Refrain

    4. Wash us, Lord, in the waters of life;
    Waters of mercy,
    Waters of hope that flow from your side.
    Refrain
