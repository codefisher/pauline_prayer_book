<hymn title="Galilee Song"
      author="Frank Anderson">
    1. Deep within my heart, I feel voices whispering to me.
    Words that I can’t understand; Meanings I can’t clearly hear!
    Calling me to follow close, lest I leave myself behind!
    Calling me to walk into evening shadows one more time!

    Refrain:
    So I leave my boats behind!
    Leave them on familiar shores!
    Set my heart upon the deep!
    Follow you again, my Lord!

    2. In my memories, I know how you send familiar rains
    falling gently on my days, dancing patterns on my pain!
    And I need to learn once more in the fortress of my mind,
    to believe in falling rain as I travel deserts dry!
    Refrain

    As I gaze into the night down the future of my years,
    I’m not sure I want to walk past horizons that I know!
    But I feel my spirit called like a stirring deep within,
    restless, ’til I live again beyond the fears that close me in!
    Refrain
