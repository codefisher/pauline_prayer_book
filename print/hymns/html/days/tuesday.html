        Holy Mary, Queen of Angels,
        Holy Angels, our Guardians,
        Holy Angels, who sing endlessly “Holy, Holy, Holy” to the Triune God,
        Holy Angels, who enlighten our minds with the light of God,
        Holy Angels whose guardianship of people is your labour of love,
        Holy Angels, who are sent to help everyone on their way to salvation,
        Holy Angels who continually look at the Face of God,
        Holy Angels, who never cease to rejoice at the repentant sinner,
        Holy Angels, who rescued Lot from certain catastrophe,
        Holy Angels, who on Mount Sinai handed to Moses the Commandments of Life,
        Holy Angels, who announced joy and peace at the birth of the Saviour,
        Holy Angels, who ministered to the Lord in the desert,
        Holy Angels, who appeared at the Lord’s tomb in dazzling brightness,
        Holy Angels, who consoled the disciples at the ‘loss’ of the Bridegroom ascending to Heaven,
        Holy Angels, who at the end of the world will call together God’s elect,
        Holy Angels, who will separate the just from the condemned,
        Holy Angels, who present our prayers before merciful God,
        Holy Angels, who escort the souls of the just to Heaven,
        Holy Angels, who protect nations and peoples,
        Holy Angels who deliver us from many dangers,

        We sinners cry to You, O God,
        Through the intercession of our Holy Guardian Angels,
        That You will forgive our sins,
        That You will protect children and youth from the Evil One,
        That You strengthen our Order in faithfulness to its charism,
        That the Holy Catholic Church may be safeguarded from the enemies’ attack,
        That You increase in the faithful, devotion to Your Holy Angels,
        That You give us the precious gift of perseverance, in Your Grace to the end,
