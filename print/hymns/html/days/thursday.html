<h1 class="index">Thursday &mdash; Prayer for Priests</h1>

<p>Almighty God, look upon the face of Him who is the eternal High Priest, and have compassion on Your priests in
    today's world. Remember that they are but weak and frail human beings. Stir up in them the grace of their vocation.
    Keep them all close to You, so that they may never do anything in the slightest degree unworthy of their sublime
    vocation.
</p>
<p>O Jesus, I pray for Your faithful and fervent priests; for those unfaithful and tepid priests; for those labouring at
    home or abroad in distant mission fields. I pray for those who are tempted; for those who are lonely and desolate;
    for those who are young; for those who are dying and for those who are in Purgatory.
</p>
<p>But above all, I recommend to
    you the priests dearest to me. I recommend the priest who baptised me; the priests who absolved me from my sins; the
    priests at whose Masses I have participated and who gave me Your Body and Blood in Holy Communion; the priests who
    instructed me or helped me by encouragement. I pray devoutly for all the priests to whom I am indebted in any other
    way in particular for <span class="rubric">(Father N.)</span>
</p>
<p>O Jesus, keep them all close to your heart, and bless them abundantly in time and in eternity.
    <br/>Amen.</p>
