<hymn title="To Jesus’ Heart, All Burning"
      author="Aloys Schlor 1805-52; Trans. A. J. Christie 1817-91">
    1. To Jesus’ Heart, all burning
    With fervent love for men, With
    My heart with fondest yearning
    Shall raise its joyful strain.

    Refrain:
    While ages course along, Blest be with loudest song
    The Sacred Heart of Jesus By every heart and tongue,
    The Sacred Heart of Jesus By every heart and tongue.

    2. O Heart, for me on fire
    love no man can speak,
    My yet untold desire
    God gives me for Thy sake.
    Refrain

    3. T’is true, I have forsaken
    Thy flock by wilful sin;
    Yet now let me be taken
    Back to thy fold again.
    Refrain

    4. As thou art meek and lowly,
    And ever pure at heart,
    So may my heart be wholly
    Of thine the counterpart.
    Refrain
