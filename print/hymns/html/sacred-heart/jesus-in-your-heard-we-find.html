<hymn title="Jesus In Your Heart We Find"
      author="James P. McAuley (1917-1976)">
    Refrain:
    Jesus, in your heart we find
    love of the Father and mankind;
    these two loves to us impart&mdash;
    Divine love in a human heart.

    1. May we stand within the fire
    Of your Sacred Heart, and raise
    To our God in joyful choir
    All creation’s song of praise.
    Refrain

    2. In our hearts, from roots of pride,
    Deadly growths of evil flower;
    But from Jesus’ wounded side
    Streams the sacramental power.
    Refrain

    3. To the depths within your heart
    Draw us with divine desire;
    Hide us, heal us, and impart
    Your own love’s transforming fire.
    Refrain
