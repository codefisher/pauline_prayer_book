<hymn title="Once in Royal David’s City"
      author="Cecil Frances Alexander 1818-95">
    1. Once in royal David’s city
    Stood a lowly cattle shed,
    Where a Mother laid her Baby
    In a manger for His bed.
    Mary was that Mother mild,
    Jesus Christ her little Child.

    2. He came down to earth from Heaven
    Who is God and Lord of all,
    And His shelter was a stable,
    And His cradle was a stall.
    With the poor and mean and lowly
    Lived on earth our Saviour holy.

    3. And through all His wondrous childhood
    He would honour and obey,
    Love and watch the lowly Maiden
    In whose gentle arms He lay.
    Christian children all should be
    Mild, obedient, good as He.

    4.For He is our childhood’s pattern,
    Day by day like us He grew;
    He was little, weak and helpless,
    Tears and smiles like us He knew:
    And He feeleth for our sadness,
    And He shareth in our gladness.

    5. And our eyes at last shall see Him,
    Through His own redeeming love;
    For that Child so dear and gentle
    Is our Lord in Heav’n above:
    And He leads His children on
    To the place where He is gone.

    6. Not in that poor lowly stable,
    With the oxen standing by,
    We shall see Him, but in Heaven,
    Set at God’s right hand on high;
    When, like stars, His children crowned
    All in white shall gather round.
