<hymn title="We Three Kings of Orient Are"
      author="John Henry Hopkins, Jr. 1820-91, Matt. 2:1-11 ">
    1. We three kings of Orient are,
    Bearing gifts we traverse afar
    Field and fountain, moor and mountain,
    Following yonder star.

    Refrain:
    Oh, star of wonder, star of night,
    Star with royal beauty bright,
    Westward leading, still proceeding,
    Guide us to the perfect Light.

    2. Born a babe on Bethlehem’s plain,
    Gold I bring to crown Him again;
    King forever, ceasing never,
    Over us all to reign.
    Refrain

    3. Frankincense to offer have I;
    Incense owns a Deity nigh,
    Pray’r and praising all men raising,
    Worshipping God on high.
    Refrain

    4. Myrrh is mine: its bitter perfume
    Breathes a life of gath’ring gloom;
    Sorrowing, sighing, bleeding, dying,
    Sealed in the stone cold tomb.
    Refrain

    5. Glorious now behold Him arise,
    King and God and sacrifice:
    Alleluia! Alleluia!
    Earth to the heav’ns replies.
    Refrain
