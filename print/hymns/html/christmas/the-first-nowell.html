<hymn title="The First Nowell"
      author="Old English Carol 17th Cent. Irregular">
    1. The first Nowell the angel did say,
    Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay;
    In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
    On a cold winterâ€™s night that was so deep:

    Refrain:
    Nowell, Nowell, Nowell, Nowell,
    Born is the King of Israel!

    2. They looked up and saw a star,
    Shining in the East, beyond them far.
    And to the earth it gave great light,
    And so it continued both day and night.
    Refrain

    4. This star drew near to the northwest.
    Over Bethlehem it came to rest,
    And there it did both stop and stay
    Right over the place where Jesus lay.
    Refrain

    3. And by the light of that same star,
    Three wise men came from country afar;
    To seek for a king was their intent,
    And to follow the star wherever it went.
    Refrain

    5. Then entered in those wise men three,
    And reverently, upon their knee.
    And offered there in His presence,
    Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.
    Refrain

    6. Now let us all with one accord
    Sing praises to our heavenly Lord,
    Who brought forth Heaven and earth from naught,
    And with His Blood mankind has bought.
    Refrain
