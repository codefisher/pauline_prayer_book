<hymn title="Joy to The World!"
      author="Isaac Watts 1674-1748, Psalm 98  ">
    1. Joy to the world! the Lord is come:
    Let earth receive her King;
    Let ev’ry heart prepare Him room,
    And Heav’n and nature sing,
    And Heav’n and nature sing,
    And Heav’n and Heav’n and nature sing.

    2. Joy to the world! the Saviour reigns:
    Let men their songs employ;
    While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains
    Repeat the sounding joy,
    Repeat the sounding joy,
    Repeat, repeat the sounding joy.

    3. He rules the world with truth and grace,
    And makes the nations prove
    The glories of His righteousness,
    And wonders of His love,
    And wonders of His love,
    And wonders, and wonders of His love.
