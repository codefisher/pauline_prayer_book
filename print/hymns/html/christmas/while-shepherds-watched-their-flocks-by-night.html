<hymn title="While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks By Night">
    1. While shepherds watched their flocks by night,
    All seated on the ground,
    The angel of the Lord came down
    And glory shone around.

    2. &ldquo;Fear not,&rdquo; said he, for mighty dread
    Had seized their troubled minds;
    &ldquo;Glad tidings of great joy I bring
    To you and all mankind.

    3. &ldquo;To you, in David's town, this day,
    Is born of David's line
    A Saviour, who is Christ the Lord;
    And this shall be the sign.

    4. The heavenly Babe you there shall find
    To human view displayed,
    All meanly wrapped in swathing bands
    And in a manger laid.&rdquo;

    5. Thus spake the seraph and forthwith
    Appeared a shining throng
    Of angels, praising God, who thus
    Addressed their joyful song:

    6. &ldquo;All glory be to God on high,
    And to the earth be peace:
    Good will henceforth from Heaven to men
    begin and never cease.&rdquo;
