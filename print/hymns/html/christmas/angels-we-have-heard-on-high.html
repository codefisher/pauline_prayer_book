<hymn title="Angels We Have Heard on High">
    1. Angels we have heard on high,
    Sweetly singing o'er the plain,
    And the mountains in reply
    Echo back their joyous strain.

    Refrain:
    Gloria in excelsis Deo,
    Gloria in excelsis Deo.

    2. Shepherds, why this jubilee?
    Why your joyous strain prolong?
    Say what may the tidings be,
    Which inspire your heavâ€™nly song.
    Refrain


    3. Come to Bethlehem and see
    Him whose birth the angels sing;
    Come adore, on bended knee,
    Christ, the Lord, the new-born King.
    Refrain

    4. See him in a manger laid,
    Whom the choirs of angels praise;
    Mary, Joseph, lend your aid,
    While our hearts in love we raise.
    Refrain
