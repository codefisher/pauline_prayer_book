<hymn title="O Come, All Ye Faithful"
      author="John F. Wade C.1711-86; Trans. Frederick Oakeley 1802-80 ">
    1. O come, all ye faithful,
    Joyful and triumphant,
    O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem;
    Come and behold Him,
    Born the King of angels:

    Refrain:
    O come, let us adore Him,
    O come, let us adore Him,
    O come, let us adore Him,
    Christ, the Lord!

    2. True God of true God,
    Light of Light eternal,
    Lo! He abhors not the Virgin’s womb;
    Son of the Father,
    Begotten, not created:
    Refrain

    3.See how the shepherds
    Summoned to his cradle,
    Leaving their flocks, draw nigh with holy fear;
    We too will thither
    Bend our joyful footsteps:
    Refrain

    4.Lo! Star-led magi,
    Wise men, Christ adoring,
    Offer him incense, gold and myrrh;
    We to the Christ-child
    Bring our hearts' oblations:
    Refrain


    5. Sing, choirs of angels,
    Sing in exultation,
    Sing, all ye citizens of heav’n above!
    “Glory to God,
    Glory in the highest”:
    Refrain

    6. Yea, Lord, we greet thee,
    Born this happy morning,
    Jesus, to thee be all glory giv’n;
    Word of the Father,
    Now in flesh appearing:
    Refrain
