<hymn title="Hark! The Herald Angels Sing"
      author="C. Wesley 1707-88">
    1. Hark! the herald Angels sing
    “Glory to the new-born King;
    Peace on earth and mercy mild,
    God and sinners reconciled!”
    Joyful all ye nations rise,
    Join the triumph of the skies;
    With the angelic hosts proclaim:
    “Christ is born in Bethlehem!”

    Refrain:
    Hark the herald Angels sing
    “Glory to the new-born King.”

    2. Christ by highest Heav’n adored,
    Christ the everlasting Lord,
    Late in time behold Him come
    Offspring of a Virgin’s womb:
    Veiled in flesh the Godhead see:
    Hail the incarnate Deity,
    Pleased as man with man to dwell,
    Jesus, our Emmanuel.
    Refrain

    3. Hail, the Heav’n-born Prince of Peace!
    Hail the Sun of Righteousness!
    Light and life to all He brings,
    Ris’n with healing in His wings;
    Mild He lays His glory by,
    Born that man no more may die,
    Born to raise the sons of earth,
    Born to give them second birth.
    Refrain
