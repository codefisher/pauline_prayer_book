<hymn title="I Heard the Voice of Jesus Say"
      author="Horatius Bonar 1808-18889">
    1. I heard the voice of Jesus say,
    “Come unto Me and rest;
    Lay down, thou weary one, lay down
    Thy head upon My breast.”
    I came to Jesus as I was,
    Weary and worn and sad;
    I found in Him a resting place,
    And He has made me glad.

    2. I heard the voice of Jesus say,
    “Behold, I freely give
    The living water; thirsty one,
    Stoop down, and drink, and live.”
    I came to Jesus, and I drank
    Of that life&mdash;giving stream;
    My thirst was quenched, my soul revived,
    And now I live in Him.

    3. I heard the voice of Jesus say,
    “I am this dark world’s Light;
    Look unto Me, thy morn shall rise,
    And all thy day be bright.”
    I looked to Jesus, and I found
    In Him my star, my sun;
    And in that light of life I’ll walk,
    Till traveling days are done.

    4. I heard the voice of Jesus say,
    “My Father’s house above
    Has many mansions; I’ve a place
    Prepared for you in love.”
    I trust in Jesus&mdash;in that house,
    According to His word,
    Redeemed by grace, my soul shall live
    Forever with the Lord.
