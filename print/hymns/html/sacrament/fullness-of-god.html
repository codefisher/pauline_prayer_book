<hymn title="Fullness of God"
      author="Fr. Frank Andersen M.S.C. 1978">
    1. Deep in Christ I pray you know the power He can give!
    May your hidden self grow strong! And may you live,
    Strong in faith and built on love, until you know
    How high and long, how wide and deep the fullness of God!

    2. May the God of Jesus Christ, the Father we serve
    Fill your mind that you may see, deep in your heart
    What hope his call now holds for you:
    His promise true: to fill your heart with power to live
    the fullness of God!

    3. Know the way you learnt from Christ, to live life anew!
    Let your heart be drawn to Him; let Christ renew
    The hope in you, to grow into... Goodness and truth!
    And living so you’ll come to know the fullness of God!
    And living so you’ll come to know, the fullness of God!
