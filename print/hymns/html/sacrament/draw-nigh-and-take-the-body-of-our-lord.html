<hymn title="Draw Nigh, and Take the Body of Our Lord"
      author="From The Antiphonary Of Bennchar 7th Cent.; Trans. John Mason Neale 1818-66">
    1. Draw nigh, and take the Body of our Lord,
    And drink the holy Blood for you outpoured,
    Saved by that Body, hallowed by that Blood,
    Whereby refreshed we render thanks to God.

    2. Salvationâ€™s giver, Christ the only Son,
    By that His Cross and Blood the victory won;
    Offered was He for greatest and for least,
    Himself the Victim, and Himself the Priest.

    3. Victims were offered by the law of old
    That, in a type, celestial mysteries told:
    He, ransomer from death and light from shade,
    Giveth His holy grace His saints to aid.

    4. Approach ye then with faithful hearts sincere,
    And take the safeguard of salvation here.
    He that in this world rules His saints and shields,
    To all believers, life eternal yields;

    5. With heavenly Bread makes them that hunger whole,
    Gives living waters to the thirsty soul.
    Alpha and Omega, to whom shall bow
    All nations at the doom, is with us now.
