<hymn title="Come to Me, All Ye Who Labour"
      author="Anonymous">
    1. “Come to Me all ye who labour, come and I will give you rest;”
    Such, dear Lord, Thine invitation to each soul to be Thy guest;
    And we answer with deep longing, while our sinfulness we see,
    “Jesus, Lord, I am not worthy, yet in pity come to me.”

    2. Here upon this altar lowly, is the food you make your home,
    While we hail Thee Lord and Master, reigning from Thy heavenly throne;
    Life without Thee would be lonely, so our hearts still cry to Thee:
    “Jesus, Lord, I am not worthy, yet in pity come to me.”

    3. All is joy when Thou art near us; earth can never bliss impart,
    Like the peace and heavenly sweetness of Thy visit to each heart;
    All unfelt are grief and sorrow, as with trust we cry to Thee:
    “Jesus, Lord, I am not worthy, yet in pity come to me.”
