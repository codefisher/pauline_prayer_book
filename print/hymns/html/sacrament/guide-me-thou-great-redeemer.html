<hymn title="Guide me O Thou Great Redeemer" author="John Hughes 1873-1932">
    1. Guide me, O thou great redeemer,
    Pilgrim through this barren land.
    I am weak, but thou art mighty,
    Hold me with thy powerful hand;
    Bread of heaven, bread of heaven
    Feed me now and evermore;
    Feed me now and evermore.

    2. Open now the crystal fountain
    Whence the living waters flow;
    Let the fiery cloudy pillar
    Lead me all my journey through:
    Strong deliverer, strong deliverer;
    Be thou still my strength and shield;
    Be thou still my strength and shield.

    3. When I tread the verge of Jordan,
    Bid my anxious fears subside;
    Death of death, and hell's destruction
    Land me safe on Canaan's side:
    Songs and praises, songs and praises,
    I will ever give to thee;
    I will ever give to thee.
