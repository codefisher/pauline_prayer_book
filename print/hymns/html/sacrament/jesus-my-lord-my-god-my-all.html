<hymn title="Jesus, My Lord, My God, My All"
      author="F. W. Faber 1814-63">
    1. Jesus, my Lord, my God, my all!
    How can I love Thee as I ought?
    And how revere this wondrous gift,
    So far surpassing hope or thought?

    Refrain:
    Sweet Sacrament, we Thee adore;
    Oh! make us love Thee more and more;
    Oh! make us love Thee more and more.

    2. Had I but Mary’s sinless heart,
    To love Thee with, my dearest King;
    Oh! with what bursts of fervent praise,
    Thy goodness, Jesus, would I sing.
    Refrain

    3. Thy Body, Soul and Godhead, All!
    O mystery of love divine
    I cannot compass all I have
    For all Thou hast and art are mine.
    Refrain

    4. Sound, sound His praises higher still,
    And come, ye angels, to our aid;
    ’Tis God, ’tis God, the very God,
    Whose pow’r both us and angels made.
    Refrain
