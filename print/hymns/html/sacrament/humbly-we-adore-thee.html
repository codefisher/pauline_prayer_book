<hymn title="Humbly We Adore Thee"
      author="Anonymous">
    1. Humbly we adore Thee, Christ Redeemer King;
    Thou art Lord of Heaven, Thou to whom we sing.
    God the mighty, Thou dost come bearing gifts of grace;
    Son of Adam, still Thou art Saviour to our race.

    2. Christ our God and brother, hear our humble plea,
    By this holy banquet, keep us joined to Thee;
    Make us one in loving Thee, one in mind and heart,
    Till in Heaven we are Thine, never more to part.

    3. Jesus Lord we thank Thee for this wondrous Bread,
    In our land Thou dwellest, by Thee we are fed.
    We who share this mystery, in Thee are made one;
    Every act we offer Thee, in Thy name is done.

    4. Thou who died to save us livest as our light,
    Though our eyes are blinded, yet our faith gives sight;
    Christ, do Thou be merciful, Lamb for sinners slain,
    We in grief confess our guilt, cleanse our souls of stain.
