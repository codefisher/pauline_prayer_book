<hymn title="Like A Shepherd"
      author="Bob Dufford, S.J. 1993 ">
    Refrain:
    Like a shepherd, He feeds his flock and gathers the lambs in His arms, Holding them carefully close to His heart, leading them home.

    1. Say to the cities of Judah: Prepare the way of the Lord.
    Go to the mountaintop, lift your voice:
    Jerusalem, here is your God.
    Refrain

    2. I myself will shepherd them, For others have led them astray.
    The lost I will rescue and heal their wounds and pasture them, giving them rest.
    Refrain

    3. Come unto me if you are heavily burdened, and take my yoke up on your shoulders. I will give you rest.
    Refrain
