<hymn title="Godhead Here in Hiding, Whom I Do Adore"
      author="Attributed to St. Thomas Aquinas 1227-1274, trans. by Gerard Manley Hopkins, S. J. 1844-1889">
    1. Godhead here in hiding, whom I do adore,
    Masked by these bare shadows, shape and nothing more,
    See, Lord, at thy service low lies here a heart
    Lost, all lost in wonder at the God thou art.

    2. Seeing, touching, tasting are in thee deceived:
    How says trusty hearing? that shall be believed;
    What God's Son hath told me, take for truth I do;
    Truth himself speaks truly, or there's nothing true.

    3. On the cross thy Godhead made no sign to men;
    Here thy very manhood steals from human ken;
    Both are my confession, both are my belief,
    And I pray the prayer of the dying thief.

    4. I am not like Thomas, wounds I cannot see,
    But can plainly call thee Lord and God as he;
    This faith each day deeper be my holding of,
    Daily make me harder hope and dearer love.

    5. O thou our reminder of Christ crucified,
    Living Bread, the life of us for whom he died,
    Lend this life to me then: feed and feast my mind,
    There be thou the sweetness man was meant to find.

    6. Jesu, whom I look at shrouded here below,
    I beseech thee send me what I long for so,
    Some day to gaze on thee face to face in light
    And be blest for ever with thy glory's sight.
