<hymn title="As the Deer" author="Martin Nystrom">
    1. As the deer pants for the water, so my soul longs after You.
    You alone are my heart’s desire and I long to worship You.

    Refrain:
    You alone are my strength, my shield,
    To You alone may my Spirit yield
    You alone are my heart’s desire and I long to worship You.

    2. I want You more than gold or silver, only You can satisfy.
    You alone are the real joy giver, and the apple of my eye,
    Refrain

    3. You’re my friend and You are my brother,
    even though You are a King.
    I love You more than any other,
    So much more than anything,
    Refrain
