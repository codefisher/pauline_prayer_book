<hymn title="Sing My Tongue, The Saviour's Glory" author="St. Thomas Aquinas 1127-74">
    1. Sing, my tongue, the Saviour’s glory
    Of His Flesh the myst’ry sing:
    Of the Blood, all price exceeding
    Shed by our immortal King,
    Destined for the world’s redemption
    From a noble womb to spring.

    2. Of a pure and spotless Virgin
    Born for us on earth below,
    He, as Man with man conversing,
    Stayed, the seeds of truth to sow;
    Then He closed in solemn order
    Wondrously His life of woe.

    3. On the night of that last supper
    Seated with His chosen band,
    He the paschal Victim eating,
    First fulfils the law’s command;
    Then, as food for His apostles,
    Gives Himself with His own hand.

    4. Word made flesh, the bread of nature
    By His word to Flesh He turns;
    Wine to His own Blood He changes:
    What though sense no change discerns?
    Only be the heart in earnest,
    Faith her lesson quickly learns.

    5. Down in adoration falling
    This great Sacrament we hail;
    Ancient types have long departed,
    Newer rites of grace prevail,
    Faith for all defects supplying
    Where the feeble senses fail

    6. Glory let us give and blessing
    To the Father and the Son,
    Honour, might and praise addressing
    While eternal ages run;
    Equal praise to Him confessing
    Who proceeds from Both as One.
