<hymn title="The Eucharist Song"
      author="Fr. Frank Andersen M.S.C.">
    1. This is My Body, take now and share!
    Deep in the memory of My own prayer.

    2. This is My Blood, come drink and live!
    In all completeness, this power I give.

    3. You are My People, My chosen friends,
    Come share the Spirit My Father sends.

    4. And hold within you, in constant hope,
    My peaceful presence, gift of My heart!
