<hymn title="Lord Jesus Christ, You Have Come to Us"
      author="Patrick Appleford, 1925">
    1. Lord Jesus Christ, You have come to us ,
    You are one with us, Mary's Son;
    Cleansing our souls from all their sin,
    Pouring Your love and goodness in,
    Jesus, our love for You we sing,
    Living Lord.

    2. Lord Jesus Christ, now and every day
    Teach us how to pray, Son of God.
    You have commanded us to do
    This in remembrance, Lord, of You:
    Into our lives Your power breaks through,
    Living Lord.

    3. Lord Jesus Christ, You have come to us,
    Born as one of us, Mary's Son.
    Led out to die on Calvary,
    Risen from death to set us free,
    Living Lord Jesus, help us see
    You are Lord.

    4. Lord Jesus Christ, I would come to You,
    Live my life for You, Son of God.
    All Your commands I know are true,
    Your many gifts will make me new,
    Into my life Your power breaks through,
    Living Lord.
