<hymn title="Sweet Sacrament Divine"
      author="F. Stanfield 1835-1914">
    1. Sweet Sacrament divine,
    Hid in Thy earthly home,
    Lo! round Thy lowly shrine,
    With suppliant hearts we come.
    Jesus, to Thee our voice we raise,
    In songs of love and heartfelt praise,
    Sweet Sacrament divine,
    Sweet Sacrament divine.

    2. Sweet Sacrament of peace,
    Dear home of every heart,
    Where restless yearnings cease,
    And sorrows all depart.
    There in Thine ear, all trustfully
    We tell our tale of misery,
    Sweet Sacrament of peace,
    Sweet Sacrament of peace.

    3. Sweet Sacrament of rest,
    Ark from the ocean’s roar,
    Within Thy shelter blest
    Soon may we reach the shore.
    Save us, for still the tempest raves;
    Save, lest we sink beneath the waves,
    Sweet Sacrament of rest,
    Sweet Sacrament of rest.

    4. Sweet Sacrament divine,
    Earth’s light and jubilee,
    In Thy far depths doth shine
    Thy Godhead’s majesty.
    Sweet light, so shine on us, we pray,
    That earthly joys may fade away,
    Sweet Sacrament divine,
    Sweet Sacrament divine.
