<hymn title="Love is His Word, Love is His Way"
      author="Luke Connaughton 1917-1979">
    1. Love is His word, love is His way,
    Feasting with men, fasting alone,
    Living and dying, rising again,
    Love only love is His way.

    Refrain:
    Richer than gold is the love of my Lord.
    Better than splendour and wealth.

    2. Love is His way, love is His mark,
    Sharing His last Passover feast,
    Christ at His table, host to the twelve,
    Love, only love, is His mark.
    Refrain

    3. Love is his mark, love is His sign,
    Bread for our strength, wine for our joy,
    “This is my body, this is my blood”,
    Love, only love is His sign.
    Refrain

    4. Love is His sign, love is His news,
    “Do this” He said “Lest you forget
    All my deep sorrow, all my dear blood”,
    Love, only love, is His news.
    Refrain

    5. Love is His news, Love is His name,
    We are His own, chosen and called,
    Family, brethren, cousins and kin.
    Love, only love is His name.
    Refrain

    6. Love is His name, love is His law.
    Hear His command, all who are His:
    “Love one another, I have loved you”.
    Love, only love, is His law.
    Refrain

    7. Love is His law, Love is His word:
    Love of the Lord, Father, and Word,
    Love of the Spirit, God ever one,
    Love, only love, is His word.
    Refrain
