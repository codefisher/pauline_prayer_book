<hymn title="O Jesus Christ Remember"
      author="Edward Caswall 1814-78">
    1. O Jesus Christ remember,
    When Thou shalt come again,
    Upon the clouds of Heaven,
    With all Thy shining train;
    When every eye shall see Thee
    In Deity reveal’d,
    Who now upon this altar
    In silence art concealed;

    2. Remember then, O Saviour,
    I supplicate of Thee,
    That here I pray’d before Thee
    Upon my bended knee;
    That here I loved Thy presence,
    And did not Thee deny,
    And glorified Thy greatness
    Though hid from human eye.

    3. Accept, divine Redeemer,
    The homage of my praise;
    Be Thou the light and honour
    And glory of my days.
    Be Thou my consolation
    When death is drawing nigh;
    Be Thou my only treasure
    Through all eternity.
