<hymn title="O Bread of Heaven"
      author="ST. ALPHONSUS 1696-1787; Trans. E. VAUGHAN 1827-1908">
    1. O Bread of Heaven, beneath this veil
    Thou dost my very God conceal:
    My Jesus, dearest treasure, hail;
    I love Thee and adoring kneel;
    Each loving soul by Thee is fed
    With Thy own Self in form of bread.

    2. O Food of life, Thou who dost give
    The pledge of immortality;
    I live; no, ’tis not I that live;
    God gives me life, God lives in me:
    He feeds my soul, He guides my ways,
    And every grief with joy repays.

    3. O bond of love, that dost unite
    The servant to his living Lord;
    Could I dare live, and not requite
    Such love, - then death were meet reward:
    I cannot live unless to prove
    Some love for such unmeasur’d love.

    4. Beloved Lord in Heaven above,
    There, Jesus, Thou awaitest me:
    To gaze on Thee with changeless love;
    Yes, thus, I hope, thus it shall be:
    For how can He deny me Heaven
    Who here on earth Himself hath given?
