<hymn title="Soul of My Saviour"
      author="Attr. Pope John XXII 1249-1334">
    1. Soul of my Saviour, sanctify my breast;
    Body of Christ, be Thou my saving guest;
    Blood of my Saviour, bathe me in Thy tide,
    Wash me with water flowing from Thy side.

    2. Strength and protection may Thy Passion be;
    O Blessed Jesus, hear and answer me;
    Deep in Thy wounds, Lord, hide and shelter me;
    So shall I never, never part from Thee.

    3. Guard and defend me from the foe malign;
    In deathâ€™s dread moments make me only Thine;
    Call me, and bid me come to Thee on high,
    When I may praise Thee with Thy saints for aye.
