<hymn title="Prayer of St. Francis (Make Me A Channel of Your Peace)"
      author="Peace Prayer of St. Francis of Assisi 1182-1226 paraphrase by Sebastian Temple">
    1. Make me a channel of your peace
    Where there is hatred let me bring your love
    Where there is injury, your pardon Lord
    And where there's doubt, true faith in you.

    2. Make me a channel of your peace
    Where there's despair in life let me bring hope.
    Where there is darkness, only light
    And where there's sadness ever joy.

    3. Oh, master grant that I may never seek
    So much to be consoled as to console,
    To be understood as to understand,
    To be loved as to love with all my soul.

    4. Make me a channel of your peace
    It is in pardoning that we are pardoned,
    In giving to all men that we receive,
    And in dying that we're born to eternal life.
