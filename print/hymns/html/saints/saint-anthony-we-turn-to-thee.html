<hymn title="Saint Anthony, We Turn to Thee (Hymn To Saint Anthony)" author="Caress C. M. Stewart">
    1. Saint Anthony, we turn to thee
    When troubles sore, distress
    Sure of your love for you didst know,
    The Christ Child’s soft caress,

    2. For you didst hear his gentle voice,
    Didst clasp him to thy breast,
    Didst feel his pretty cheek ‘gainst thine,
    His arms about thee pressed.

    3. O gentle Saint tell him our needs,
    His children too are we,
    O ask Him now to grant our pray’rs
    And we at peace shall be.

    4. We would, O blessed Saint, with thee
    The Holy Child adore
    With hearts as pure as thine dear Saint,
    Now and forever more.
