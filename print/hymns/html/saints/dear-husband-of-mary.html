<hymn title="Dear Husband of Mary">
    1. Dear husband of Mary! dear nurse of her child!
    Lifeâ€™s ways are full weary, the desert is wild;
    Bleak sands are all round us, no home can we see;
    Sweet Spouse of our Lady! we lean upon thee.

    2. For thou to the pilgrim art father and guide,
    And Jesus and Mary felt safe at thy side;
    Ah! blessed Saint Joseph, how safe should I be,
    Sweet Spouse of our Lady, if thou were with me.

    3. O blessed Saint Joseph, how great was thy worth,
    The one chosen shadow of God upon earth,
    The father of Jesus! Ah, then wilt thou be,
    Dear spouse of Our Lady, a father to me.

    4. When the treasures of God were unsheltered on earth,
    Safe keeping was found for them both in thy worth
    As father to Jesus, be father to me.
    Sweet spouse of our lady and I will love Thee!
