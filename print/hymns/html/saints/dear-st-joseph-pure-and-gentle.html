<hymn title="Dear St. Joseph, Pure and Gentle">
    1. Dear St. Joseph, pure and gentle, 
    Guardian of the Saviour child, 
    Treading with the virgin mother, 
    Egypt's deserts rough and wild.

    Refrain:
    Hail, St. Joseph, spouse of Mary, 
    Blessed above all saints on high,
    When the death-shades round us gather, 
    Teach, oh, teach us how to die.
    Teach, oh, teach us how to die.

    2. He who rested on thy bosom
    Is by countless saints adored; 
    Prostrate angels in His presence 
    Sing hosannas to their Lord.
    Refrain

    3. Dear St. Joseph, kind and loving,
    Stretch to us a helping hand;
    Guide us through life's toils and sorrows
    Safely to the distant land.
    Refrain
