<hymn title="By Every Nation"
      author="H.B. George 1838-1910">
    1. By ev’ry nation, race and tongue,
    Worship and praise be ever sung;
    Praise the Father: Alleluia!
    For pardoned sin, death overcome,
    And hopes that live beyond the tomb:
    Alleluia, alleluia!
    Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!

    2. Saints who on earth have suffered long
    For Jesus’ sake enduring wrong,
    Ever faithful: Alleluia!
    Where faith is lost in sight, rejoice
    And sing with never wearied voice:
    Alleluia, alleluia!
    Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!

    3. Let earth and air and sea unite
    To celebrate His glorious might,
    Their Creator: Alleluia!
    Sun, moon and stars in endless space
    Echo the song of ev’ry race:
    Alleluia, alleluia!
    Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!
