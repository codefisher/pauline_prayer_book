<hymn title="Blest Are They" author="David Haas">
    1. Blest are they, the poor in spirit;
    Theirs is the kingdom of God.
    Blest are they, full of sorrow,
    They shall be consoled.

    Refrain:
    Rejoice and be glad!
    Blessed are you; holy are you!
    Rejoice and be glad!
    Yours is the Kingdom of God!

    2. Blest are they, the lowly ones;
    They shall inherit the earth.
    Blest are they, who hunger and thirst;
    They shall have their fill.
    Refrain

    3. Blest are they who show mercy;
    Mercy shall be theirs.
    Blest are they, the pure of heart;
    They shall see God!
    Refrain

    4. Blest are they who seek peace;
    They are the children of God.
    Blest are they who suffer in faith,
    The glory of God is theirs.
    Refrain

    5. Blest are you who suffer hate
    All because of me.
    Rejoice and be glad, yours is the kingdom,
    Shine for all to see.
    Refrain
