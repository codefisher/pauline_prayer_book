<hymn title="For All the Saints"
      author="William W. How 1823-97">
    1. For all the saints who from their labours rest,
    Who Thee by faith before the world confessed,
    Thy name, O Jesu, be for ever blest.
    Alleluia! Alleluia!

    2. Thou wast their Rock, their fortress, and their might;
    Thou, Lord, their Captain in the well-fought fight;
    Thou in the darkness drear their one true Light.
    Alleluia! Alleluia!

    3. O may Thy soldiers, faithful, true, and bold,
    Fight as the saints who nobly fought of old,
    And win, with them, the victor’s crown of gold.
    Alleluia! Alleluia!

    4. O blest communion, fellowship divine!
    We feebly struggle, they in glory shine;
    Yet all are one in Thee for all are Thine.
    Alleluia! Alleluia!

    5. But lo! there breaks a yet more glorious day;
    The Saints triumphant rise in bright array:
    The King of glory passes on His way.
    Alleluia! Alleluia!

    6. From earth’s wide bounds, from ocean’s farthest coast,
    Through gates of pearl streams in the countless host,
    Singing to Father, Son and Holy Ghost:
    Alleluia! Alleluia!
