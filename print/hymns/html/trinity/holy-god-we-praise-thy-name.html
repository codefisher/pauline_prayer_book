<hymn title="Holy God, We Praise Thy Name"
      author="C. A. Walworth 1820-1900  ">
    1. Holy God, we praise Thy name;
    Lord of all, we bow before Thee
    All on earth Thy sceptre claim,
    All in Heaven above adore Thee.
    Infinite Thy vast domain,
    Everlasting is Thy reign.

    2. Hark! the loud celestial hymn,
    Angel choirs above are raising;
    Cherubim and seraphim,
    In unceasing chorus praising,
    Fill the heavens with sweet accord,
    Holy, holy, holy Lord.

    3. Holy Father, holy Son,
    Holy Spirit, Three we name Thee;
    While in Essence only One
    Undivided God we â€™claim Thee;
    And adoring bend the knee,
    While we own the mystery.

    4. Thou art King of glory, Christ:
    Son of God, yet born of Mary,
    For us sinners sacrificed,
    And to death a tributary:
    First to break the bars of death,
    Thou has opened Heaven to faith.

    5. Lo, the apostolic train
    Join Thy sacred name to hallow!
    Prophets swell the loud refrain,
    And with white&mdash;robed martyrs follow;
    And from morn to set of sun
    Through the Church the song goes on.
