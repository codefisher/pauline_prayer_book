<hymn title="Firmly I Believe and Truly"
      author="Newman 1801-90">
    1. Firmly I believe and truly
    God is Three, and God is One
    And I next acknowledge duly
    Manhood taken by the Son.

    2. And I trust and hope most fully
    In that manhood crucified;
    And each thought and deed unruly
    Do to death, as He has died.

    3. Simply to His grace and wholly
    Light and life and strength belong;
    And I love supremely, solely,
    Him the holy, Him the strong.

    4. And I hold in veneration,
    For the love of Him alone,
    Holy Church, as His creation,
    And her teachings, as His own.

    5. Adoration aye be given,
    With and through the angelic host,
    To the God of earth and Heaven,
    Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
