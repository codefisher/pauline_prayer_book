      author="Author: George Hunt Smyttan (1822-1870), 1856; alt. by Francis Pott 1832-1909. Scripture: Matthew 6:1-2 Luke 4:1-2">
    1. Forty days and forty nights
    You were fasting in the wild;
    Forty days and forty nights
    Tempted, and yet undefiled.

    2. Shall not we Your trial share
    And from worldly joys abstain,
    Fasting with unceasing prayer,
    Glad with You to suffer pain?

    3. And if Satan on us press,
    Flesh or spirit to assail,
    Victor in the wilderness,
    Grant we may not faint or fail!

    4. So shall we have peace divine:
    Holier gladness ours shall be;
    Round us, too, shall angels shine,
    Such as served You faithfully.

    5. Guard and keep us, Saviour dear,
    Ever constant by Your side;
    That with You we may appear
    At the eternal Eastertide.
