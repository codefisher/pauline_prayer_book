<hymn title="Come to Me"
      author="The Benedictine Foundation of the State of Vermont, Inc, 1971">
    Refrain:
    Come to me, all who labour and are heavy burdened,
    And I shall give you rest.
    Take up my yoke and learn from me,
    For I am meek and humble of heart.
    And youâ€™ll find rest for your souls.
    Yes, my yoke is easy and my burden is light.

    1. The Lord is my shepherd, I shall never be in need.
    Fresh and green are the meadows where he gives me rest.
    Refrain
