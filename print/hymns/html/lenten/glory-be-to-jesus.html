      author="Anonymous, Italian 18th Cent.; Trans. Edward Caswall 1814-78">
    1. Glory be to Jesus,
    Who in bitter pains
    Pour’d for me the Life-Blood
    From His sacred veins.

    2. Grace and life eternal
    In that Blood I find:
    Blest be His compassion,
    Infinitely kind.

    3. Blest through endless ages
    Be the precious stream,
    Which from endless torment
    Does the world redeem.


    4. There the fainting spirit
    Drinks of life her fill;
    There as in a fountain
    Laves herself at will.

    5. Oft’ as it is sprinkled
    On our guilty hearts,
    Satan in confusion
    Terror-struck departs.

    6. Abel’s blood for vengeance
    Pleaded to the skies;
    But the Blood of Jesus
    For our pardon cries.

    7. Lift ye, then, your voices;
    Swell the mighty flood;
    Louder still and louder,
    Praise the Precious Blood.
