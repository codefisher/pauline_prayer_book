<hymn title="O Sacred Head, Sore Wounded"
      author="Paul Gerhardt, 1607-1676">
    1. O sacred head, sore wounded,
    With grief and shame weighed down,
    O kingly head surrounded
    With thorns, Thine only crown.
    Death’s pallor now comes o’er thee,
    The glow of life decays;
    Yet hosts of heav’n adore thee
    And tremble as they gaze.

    2. What language shall I borrow
    To praise Thee, heav’nly friend,
    For this, Thy dying sorrow,
    Thy pity without end?
    O agony and dying!
    O love to sinners free!
    Jesus, all grace supplying,
    Turn Thou Thy face on me.

    3. In this Thy bitter Passion,
    Good Shepherd think of me
    With thy most sweet compassion
    Unworthy though I be:
    Beneath thy cross abiding
    For ever would I rest,
    In thy dear love confiding,
    And with thy presence blest.

    4. Be Thou my Consolation,
    My shield, when I must die;
    Remind me of Thy Passion
    When my last hour draws nigh.
    Mine eyes shall then behold Thee,
    Upon Thy cross shall dwell,
    My heart by faith enfold Thee.
    Who dieth thus, dies well!
