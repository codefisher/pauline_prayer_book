<hymn title="May This Lenten Discipline"
      author="James Phillip McAuley, 1917-1976">
    Refrain:
    May this Lenten discipline,
    Which we undertake with love,
    Turn our minds to things above.

    1. Sin has sundered us from God,
    Selfish we have grown and cold,
    Foolish were the ways we trod,
    Evil habits keep their hold.
    Refrain

    2. As we keep this Lent with prayer
    And from pleasures are withdrawn,
    Minds and bodies we prepare
    For the joy of Easter dawn.
    Refrain

    3. Now we fast that we may feast
    Where the Lord of Life presides;
    May our hunger be increased
    For the bread which he provides.
    Refrain
