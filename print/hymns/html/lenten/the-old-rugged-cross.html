<hymn title="The Old Rugged Cross"
      author="George Bennard, 1913">
    1. On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,
    The emblem of suff’ring and shame;
    And I love that old cross where the dearest and Best
    For a world of lost sinners was slain.

    Refrain:
    So I’ll cherish the old rugged cross,
    Til my trophies at last I lay down;
    I will cling to the old rugged cross,
    And exchange it someday for a crown.

    2. Oh, that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,
    Has a wondrous attraction for me;
    For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above
    To bear it to dark Calvary.
    Refrain

    3. In that old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine,
    A wondrous beauty I see,
    For ’twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died,
    To pardon and sanctify me.
    Refrain

    4. To the old rugged cross I will ever be true;
    Its shame and reproach gladly bear;
    Then He’ll call me someday to my home far away,
    Where His glory forever I’ll share.
    Refrain
