<hymn title="Softly and Tenderly"  author="Will L. Thompson">
    1. Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling,
    Calling to you and to me.
    See, on the altar, He's waiting and watching;
    Watching for you and for me.

    Refrain:
    O come to me, O come to me,
    You who are weary O come to me;
    Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling;
    Calling, &ldquo;My child, come to me!&rdquo;

    2. Why should we tarry when Jesus is pleading, 
    Pleading for you and for me? 
    Why should we linger and heed not his mercies, 
    Mercies for you and for me? 
    Refrain

    3. O for the wonderful love He has promised,
    Promised for you and for me.
    Though we have sinned, He has mercy and pardon;
    Pardon for you and for me.
    Refrain
