<hymn title="Hear, O Lord, The Sound of My Call"
      author="Ray Repp">
    Refrain:
    Hear, O Lord, the sound of my call;
    Hear, O Lord and have mercy
    My soul is longing for the glory of you.
    O hear, O Lord and answer me.

    1. From the depths I call to you, sweet Jesus, hear my cry.
    Oh let your ears be ever keen to hear me when I sigh.
    Refrain

    2. If the Lord should mark our guilt, what creature would survive?
    But God to us his mercy shows, and fallen souls revive.
    Refrain

    3. So my soul waits for the Lord, no longer so forlorn.
    my soul is longing for the Lord as watchmen wait for dawn.
    Refrain

    4. Glory now to God be given, the Father and the Son,
    and Holy Spirit, Gift of Love, for ever Three in One.
    Refrain
