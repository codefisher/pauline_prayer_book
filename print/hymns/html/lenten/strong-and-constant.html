<hymn title="Strong and Constant"
      author="Fr. Frank Andersen M.S.C.">
    1. I will be your God who walks with you!
    You will be always within my hand!
    Take your heart and give it all to me!

    Refrain:
    Strong and constant is my love!
    Strong and constant is my love!

    2. Should you wander far away from me,
    I will search for you in evâ€™ry land.
    Should you call, then you will truly know:
    Refrain

    3. When you know sorrow within your life,
    I will come, I will embrace your heart.
    Through your pain you will discover me.
    Refrain
