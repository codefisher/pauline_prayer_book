<hymn title="Come Back to Me"
      author="Text based on Hosea Chapter 2, by Gregory Norbert, O.S.B.">
    1. Come back to me with all your heart,
    Don’t let fear keep us apart.
    Trees do bend, tho’ straight and tall;
    So must we to others’ call.

    Refrain:
    Long have I waited for your coming
    Home to me and living deeply our new life.

    2. The wilderness will lead you
    To your heart where I will speak.
    Integrity and justice, with tenderness you shall know.
    Refrain

    3. You shall sleep secure with peace;
    Faithfulness will be your joy.
    Refrain
