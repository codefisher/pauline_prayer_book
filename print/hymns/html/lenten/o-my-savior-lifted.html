      author="William Walsham How 1823-97">
    1. O my Saviour, lifted
    From the earth for me,
    Draw me, in Thy mercy,
    Nearer unto Thee.

    2. Lift my earth-bound longings,
    Fix them, Lord, above;
    Draw me with the magnet
    Of Thy mighty love.

    3. Lord, Thine arms are stretching
    Ever far and wide
    To enfold Thy children
    To Thy loving side.

    4. And I come, Lord Jesus:
    Dare I turn away?
    No, Thy love hath conquered,
    And I come today.

    5. Bringing all my burdens,
    Sorrow, sin and care,
    At Thy feet I lay them,
    And I leave them there.
