<hymn title="God of Mercy"
      author="E. Vaughan 1827-1908 ">
    1. God of mercy and compassion,
    Look with pity upon me;
    Father, let me call Thee Father,
    ’Tis Thy child returns to Thee.


    Refrain:
    Jesus, Lord, I ask for mercy;
    Let me not implore in vain;
    All my sins I now detest them,
    Never will I sin again.

    2. By my sins I have deserved
    Death and endless misery,
    Hell with all its pains and torments,
    And for all eternity.
    Refrain

    3. By my sins I have abandon’d
    Right and claim to Heaven above,
    Where the saints rejoice for ever
    In a boundless sea of love.
    Refrain

    4. See our Saviour, bleeding dying,
    On the Cross of Calvary;
    To that Cross my sins have nail’d Him,
    Yet He bleeds and dies for me.
    Refrain
