    Refrain:
    Water of life, cleanse and refresh us;
    Raise us to life in Christ Jesus.

    1. All you who thirst, come to the waters,
    And you will never be thirsty again.
    Refrain

    2. As rain from heav’n, so is God’s word, it
    Waters the earth and brings forth life.
    Refrain

    3. Dying with Christ, so we shall rise with him,
    Death shall no longer have pow’r over us.
    Refrain

    4. Turn to the Lord, cast off your wickedness,
    You will find peace in his infinite love.
    Refrain
