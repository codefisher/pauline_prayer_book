<hymn title="Sing a New Song Unto the Lord"
      author="Daniel Schutte, 1972, 2008">
    Refrain:
    Sing a new song unto the Lord;
    let your song be sung from mountains high.
    Sing a new song unto the Lord, singing alleluia.

    1. Shout with gladness, dance for joy. O come before the Lord.
    And play for Him on glad tambourines, and let your trumpet sound.
    Refrain

    2. Rise, O children, from your sleep; your Saviour now has come.
    He has turned your sorrow to joy, and filled your soul with song.
    Refrain

    3. Glad my soul for I have seen the glory of the Lord.
    The trumpet sounds; the dead shall be raised. I know my Saviour lives.
    Refrain
