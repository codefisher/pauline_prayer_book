<hymn title="An Upper Room Did Our Lord Prepare"
      author="Frederick Pratt Green 1903-2000">
    1. An upper room did our Lord prepare
    For those he loved until the end:
    And his disciples still gather there
    To celebrate their risen friend.

    2. A lasting gift Jesus gave his own:
    To share his bread, his loving cup.
    Whatever burdens may bow us down,
    He by his cross shall lift us up.

    3. And after supper he washed their feet,
    For service, too, is sacrament.
    In Him our joy shall be made complete&mdash;
    Sent out to serve, as he was sent.

    4. No end there is! We depart in peace.
    He loves beyond the uttermost:
    In every room in our Father's house
    He will be there, as Lord and Host.
