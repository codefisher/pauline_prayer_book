<hymn title="Easter Glory Fills the Sky"
      author="James Quinn 1969">
    1. Easter glory fills the sky; Alleluia!
    Christ now lives, no more to die; Alleluia!
    Darkness has been put to flight, Alleluia!
    By the living Lord of Light. Alleluia!

    2. See the stone is rolled away, alleluia!
    From the tomb where once he lay; Alleluia!
    He has risen as he said, Alleluia!
    Glorious firstborn of the dead, Alleluia!


    3. Mary Mother, greet your Son, alleluia!
    Radiant from his triumph won; Alleluia!
    By his cross you shared his pain, Alleluia!
    So for ever share his reign, Alleluia!

    4. Magd’len, wipe away your tears! Alleluia!
    He has come who calms all fear! Alleluia!
    Hear the master speak your name; Alleluia!
    Turn to him with heart aflame! Alleluia!

    5. Though we see his face no more, alleluia!
    He is with us as before! Alleluia!
    Glory veiled, he is our priest, alleluia!
    His true flesh and blood our feast! Alleluia!

    6. Christ, the victor over death, alleluia!
    Breathes on us the Spirit’s breath! Alleluia!
    Paradise is our reward, Alleluia!
    Endless Easter with our Lord! Alleluia!
