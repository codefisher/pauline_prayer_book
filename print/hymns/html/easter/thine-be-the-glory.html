<hymn title="Thine be the Glory, Risen, Conqu’ring Son"
      author="Adapted from George F. Handel 1685-1759">
    1. Thine be the glory, risen, conqu'ring Son,
    Endless is the vict'ry Thou o'er death hast won;
    Angels in bright raiment rolled the stone away,
    Kept the folded grave-clothes, where Thy body lay. 

    Refrain:
    Thine be the glory, risen, conqu'ring Son,
    Endless is the vict'ry Thou o'er death hast won. 

    2. Lo! Jesus meets us, risen from the tomb;
    Lovingly He greets us, scatters fear and gloom;
    Let the Church with gladness, hymns of triumph sing,
    For her Lord now liveth, death hath lost its sting.
    Refrain

    3. No more we doubt thee, glorious Prince of life!
    Life is naught without thee; aid us in our strife.
    Make us more than conqu’rors through thy deathless love;
    bring us safe through Jordan to thy home above.
    Refrain
