<hymn title="We Remember"
      author="Marty Haugen">
    Refrain:
    We remember how you loved us to your death,
    And still we celebrate, for you are with us here;
    And we believe that we will see you when you come,
    In your glory, Lord, we remember, we celebrate, we believe.

    1. Here, a million wounded souls are
    Yearning just to touch you and be healed;
    Gather all your people, and hold them to your heart;
    Refrain

    2. Now we recreate your love, we
    Bring the bread and wine to share a meal;
    Sign of grace and mercy, the presence of the Lord;
    Refrain

    3. Christ, the Father's great "Amen",
    To all the hopes and dreams of every heart;
    Peace beyond all telling, and freedom from all fear;
    Refrain

    4. See the face of Christ revealed in
    Ev'ry person standing by your side;
    Gift to one another, and temples of your love;
    Refrain
