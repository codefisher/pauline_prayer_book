<hymn title="Sing to The Mountains"
      author="Bob Dufford, 1943">
    Refrain:
    Sing to the mountains, sing to the sea.
    Raise your voices, lift your hearts.
    This is the day the Lord has made.
    Let all the earth rejoice.

    1. I will give thanks to you, my Lord.
    You have answered my plea.
    You have saved my soul from death.
    You are my strength and my song.
    Refrain

    2. Holy, holy, holy Lord.
    Heaven and earth are full of your glory.
    Refrain

    3. This is the day the Lord has made.
    Let us be glad and rejoice.
    He has turned all death to life.
    Sing of the glory of God.
    Refrain
