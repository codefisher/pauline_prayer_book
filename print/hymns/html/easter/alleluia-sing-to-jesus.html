<hymn title="Alleluia! Sing To Jesus!"
      author="William Chatterton Dix 1837-98  ">
    1. Alleluia! sing to Jesus!
    His the sceptre, His the throne;
    Alleluia! His the triumph,
    His the victory alone;
    Hark! the songs of peaceful Sion
    Thunder like a mighty flood;
    Jesus, out of ev’ry nation
    Hath redeemed us by His Blood.

    2. Alleluia! not as orphans
    Are we left in sorrow now;
    Alleluia! He is near us,
    Faith believes, nor questions how:
    Though the cloud from sight received Him,
    When the forty days were o’er,
    Shall our hearts forget His promise,
    “I am with you evermore”?

    3. Alleluia! Bread of Angels,
    Thou on earth our food, our stay!
    Alleluia! here the sinful
    Flee to Thee from day to day:
    Intercessor, friend of sinners,
    Earth’s Redeemer, plead for me,
    Where the songs of all the sinless
    Sweep across the crystal sea.

    4. Alleluia! King eternal,
    Thee the Lord of lords we own;
    Alleluia! born of Mary,
    Earth Thy footstool, Heav’n Thy throne:
    Thou within the veil hast entered,
    Robed in flesh, our great High Priest;
    Thou on earth both Priest and Victim
    In the Eucharistic feast.
