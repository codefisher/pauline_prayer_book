<hymn title="Christ The Lord Is Risen Today"
      author="Trans. Jane E. Leeson 1807-82">
    1. Christ the Lord is risen today, Alleluia
    Christians, haste your vows to pay; Alleluia
    Offer ye your praises meet, Alleluia
    At the Paschal Victim’s feet; Alleluia.


    2. For the sheep the Lamb hath bled, Alleluia
    Sinless in the sinner’s stead. Alleluia
    Christ the Lord is ris’n on high; Alleluia
    Now He lives, no more to die. Alleluia.

    3. Christ, the Victim undefil’d, Alleluia.
    Man to God hath reconcil’d; Alleluia.
    When in strange and awful strife, Alleluia.
    Met together death and life; Alleluia.

    4. Christians, on this happy day, Alleluia.
    Haste with joy your vows to pay. Alleluia.
    Christ the Lord is ris’n on high; Alleluia.
    Now He lives, no more to die. Alleluia.
