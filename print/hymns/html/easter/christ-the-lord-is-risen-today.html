<hymn title="Christ The Lord Is Risen Today"
      author="Trans. Jane E. Leeson 1807-82">
    1. Christ the Lord is risen today,
    Christians, haste your vows to pay;
    Offer ye your praises meet
    At the Paschal Victim’s feet;
    Alleluia.

    2. For the sheep the Lamb hath bled,
    Sinless in the sinner’s stead.
    Christ the Lord is ris’n on high;
    Now He lives, no more to die.
    Alleluia.

    3. Christ, the Victim undefil’d,
    Man to God hath reconcil’d;
    When in strange and awful strife
    Met together death and life;
    Alleluia.

    4. Christians, on this happy day
    Haste with joy your vows to pay.
    Christ the Lord is ris’n on high;
    Now He lives, no more to die.
    Alleluia.

    5. Christ, who once for sinners bled,
    Now the first-born from the dead,
    Thron’d in endless might and power,
    Lives and reigns for evermore.
    Alleluia.

    6. Hail, eternal hope on high!
    Hail, Thou King of victory!
    Hail, Thou Prince of life ador’d!
    Help and save us, gracious Lord.
    Alleluia.
