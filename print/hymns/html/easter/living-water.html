<hymn title="Living Water" author="F. Anderson">
    Refrain:
    I will give you living water,
    Shade to rest under, strength to your heart!
    Grow deep within me, filled by my Spirit.
    My burdens are easy and my life it is yours!

    1. We have been with the lonely!
    To the hungry we’ve given your bread.
    We now come with all our hopes and dreams
    To rest awhile with you!
    Refrain

    2. To the empty, we’ve carried
    Your Word of hope and of life.
    Build us now beyond our hopes and dreams
    ‘til we live in you!
    Refrain
