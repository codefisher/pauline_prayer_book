<hymn title="Hail the Day That Sees Him Rise"
      author="Charles Wesley 1707-88">
    1. Hail the day that sees Him rise. Alleluia!
    To His throne above the skies; Alleluia!
    Christ, awhile to mortals given, Alleluia!
    Re-ascends His native Heaven. Alleluia!

    2. There for Him high triumph waits; Alleluia!
    Lift your heads, eternal gates; Alleluia!
    He has conquered death and sin; Alleluia!
    Take the King of glory in. Alleluia!

    3. Highest Heaven its Lord receives, Alleluia!
    Yet He loves the earth He leaves: Alleluia!
    Though returning to His throne, Alleluia!
    Still He calls mankind His own. Alleluia!

    4. See, He lifts His hands above. Alleluia!
    See, He shows the prints of love. Alleluia!
    Hark, His gracious lips bestow Alleluia!
    Blessings on His Church below. Alleluia!

    5. Still for us He intercedes, Alleluia!
    His prevailing death He pleads, Alleluia!
    Near Himself prepares our place, Alleluia!
    He the first fruits of our race. Alleluia!

    6. There we shall with Thee remain, Alleluia!
    Partners of Thy endless reign; Alleluia!
    There Thy face unclouded see, Alleluia!
    Find our Heav’n of heav’ns in Thee. Alleluia!
