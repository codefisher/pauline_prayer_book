<hymn title="Prepare the Way"
      author="Brian Boniwell 1949-">
    1. There was a man of God whose name was John.
    He came to speak for the Light,
    The voice of one in the wilderness:
    &ldquo;Prepare the way of the Lord.&rdquo;

    Refrain:
    Prepare the way of the Lord.
    Prepare the way of the Lord.
    Prepare the way of the Lord.
    Prepare the way of the Lord.

    2. Mountains and hills shall be brought to the ground,
    The winding paths be straightened
    And all on earth shall see his face;
    Prepare the way of the Lord.
    Refrain

    3. He is the Lamb of God and you must follow Him
    Who takes the sin of the world,
    For He has come to give you life.
    Prepare the way of the Lord.
    Refrain
