<hymn title="O Come, O Come, Emmanuel"
      author="Trans. T. Helmore 1811-90">
    1. O come, O come, Emmanuel,
    And ransom captive Israel,
    That mourns in lonely exile here
    Until the Son of God appear.

    Refrain:
    Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
    Shall come to thee, O Israel!

    2. O come, Thou Wisdom, from on high,
    And order all things far and nigh;
    To us the path of knowledge show,
    And teach us in her ways to go.
    Refrain

    3. O come, O come, Thou Holy Lord of might,
    Who in Thy tribes on Sinai’s height
    In ancient times didst give the law,
    In cloud, and majesty, and awe.
    Refrain

    4. O come, Thou rod of Jesse’s stem,
    From ev’ry foe deliver them.
    From death and sin Thy people save,
    And give them vict’ry o’er the grave.
    Refrain

    5. O come, Thou key of David, come,
    And open wide our heav’nly home;
    Make safe the way that leads on high,
    And close the path to misery.
    Refrain

    6. O come, Thou Dayspring, come and cheer
    Our spirits by Thine advent here;
    Disperse the gloomy clouds of night
    And death’s dark shadow put to flight.
    Refrain

    7. O come, Desire of nations, bind
    In one the hearts of all mankind;
    Bid ev’ry sad divisions cease,
    And be Thyself our Prince of Peace.
    Refrain
