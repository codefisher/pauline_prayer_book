<hymn title="Come, Thou Long-Expected Jesus"
      author="Charles Wesley 1707-1788">
    1. Come, thou long-expected Jesus,
    Born to set Thy people free,
    From our fears and sins release us,
    Let us find our rest in Thee.

    2. Israelâ€™s Strength and Consolation,
    Hope of all the earth Thou art;
    Dear Desire of every nation,
    Joy of every longing heart.

    3. Born Thy people to deliver,
    Born a child, and yet a king!
    Born to reign in us forever,
    Now Thy gracious kingdom bring.

    4. By Thine own eternal Spirit,
    Rule in all our hearts alone;
    By Thine all sufficient merit
    Raise us to Thy glorious throne.
