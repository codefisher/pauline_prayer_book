<hymn title="On Jordan’s Bank the Baptist’s Cry"
      author="Charles Coffin 1736; Trans. John Chandler 1837">
    1. On Jordan’s bank the Baptist’s cry
    Announces that the Lord is nigh;
    Awake and hearken, for he brings
    Glad tidings of the King of kings.

    2. Then cleansed be every heart from sin;
    Make straight the way of God within,
    And let each heart prepare a home
    Where such a mighty guest may come.

    3. For You are our salvation, Lord,
    Our refuge, and our great reward;
    Without Your grace, we waste away,
    Like flowers that wither and decay.

    4. To heal the sick stretch out Your hand,
    And bid the fallen sinner stand;
    Shine forth, and let Your light restore
    Earth’s own true loveliness once more.

    5. To God the Son, all glory be,
    Whose advent sets His people free;
    Whom with the Father we adore
    And Holy Ghost evermore.
