<hymn title="The Angel Gabriel from Heaven Came"
      author="Basque carol; English version by Sabine Baring-Gould, 1834-1924">
    1. The Angel Gabriel from heaven came,
    his wings as drifted snow, his eyes as flame;
    &lsquo;All hail,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;thou lowly maiden Mary,
    most highly favoured lady.&rsquo; Gloria!

    2. &lsquo;For know a blessed Mother thou shalt be,
    All generations laud and honour thee,
    Thy Son shall be Emmanuel, by seers foretold;
    Most highly favoured lady.&rsquo; Gloria!

    3. Then gentle Mary meekly bowed her head,
    &lsquo;To me be as it pleaseth God,&rsquo; she said,
    &lsquo;My soul shall laud and magnify his holy name&rsquo;;
    Most highly favoured lady. Gloria!

    4. Of her, Emmanuel, the Christ was born
    In Bethlehem, all on a Christmas morn,
    And Christian folk throughout the world will ever say;
    &lsquo;Most highly favoured lady.&rsquo; Gloria!
