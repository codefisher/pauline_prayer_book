<hymn title="I, The Word of God Will Treasure"
      author="John de Luca, 1942-">
    1. I, the Word of God will treasure all of my life:
    Truth and Justice without measure, healing our strife.
    Jesus, Word of God, our Brother,
    I will love and serve no other:
    Follow this tremendous Lover, all of my life.

    2. Word in Scripture, sure foundation: Source of true life:
    Gospel! Good News: new creation â€“ darkness made bright.
    In the footsteps of the Master we are safe from all disaster;
    Joy eternal ever after this earthly life.

    3. Word made flesh, the bread of nature change with Your might!
    True encounter with our Maker, now hid from sight.
    Eucharistic transformation&mdash;
    Power of God, our hearts to waken&mdash;
    Never will we be forsaken, all through our life.
