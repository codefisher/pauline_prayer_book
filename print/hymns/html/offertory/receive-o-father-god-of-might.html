<hymn title="Receive O Father, God of Might"
      author="David Michael Coffey, 1934-">
    1. Receive O Father, God of might,
    This host unblemished in Your sight.
    Unworthy servants though we be,
    We come before You, trustingly.

    2. This saving chalice too, we bring.
    Receive it graciously O king.
    With fragrant odour may it rise
    To Your fine home, above the skies.

    3. For all the living and the dead,
    For our poor lives so badly led,
    We raise these gifts to You above,
    And join to them ourselves in love.

    4. And being pleased Your gift bestow&mdash;
    The life of grace in us below.
    Not just to us this blessing send,
    To all the world let it extend.
