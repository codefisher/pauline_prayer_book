<hymn title="Fill My House"
      author="Peter Kearney">
    1. Fill my house unto the fullest,
    Eat my bread and drink my wine,
    The love I bear is held from no-one:

    Refrain:
    All I own and all I do I give to you.

    2. Take my time unto the fullest,
    Find in me the trust you seek,
    Take my hands to you outreaching:
    Refrain

    3. Christ our Lord with love enormous,
    From the cross His lesson taught:
    Love each one as I have loved you:
    Refrain

    4. Join with me as one in Christ-love,
    May our hearts all beat as one;
    May we give ourselves completely:
    Refrain
