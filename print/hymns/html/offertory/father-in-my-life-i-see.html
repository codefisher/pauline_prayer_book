<hymn title="Father, In My Life I See"
      author="Fr. Frank Andersen, M.S.C.">
    1. Father, in my life I see, 
    You are God who walks with me! 
    You hold my life in Your hands:
    Close beside You I will stand!
    I give all my life to You, help me Father to be true! 

    2. Jesus, in my life I see, 
    You are God who walks with me! 
    You hold my life in Your hands:
    Close beside You I will stand!
    I give all my life to You, help me Jesus to be true! 

    3. Spirit, in my life I see, 
    You are God who walks with me!
    You hold my life in Your hands:
    Close beside You I will stand!
    I give all my life to You, help me Spirit to be true!
