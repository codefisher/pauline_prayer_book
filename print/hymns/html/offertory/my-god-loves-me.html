<hymn title="My God Loves Me"
      columns="columns">
    1. My God loves me.
    His love will never end.
    He rests within my heart,
    For my God loves me.

    2. His gentle Hand,
    He stretches over me.
    Though storm-clouds threaten the day,
    He will set me free.

    3. He comes to me
    In sharing bread and wine,
    He brings me life that will reach
    Past the end of time.

    4. My God loves me,
    His faithful love endures.
    And I will live like a child
    Held in love secure.

    5. The joys of love
    As offerings now we bring,
    The pains of love will be lost
    In the praise we sing.
