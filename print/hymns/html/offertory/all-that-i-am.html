<hymn title="All that I am"
      author="Sebastian Temple">
    1. All that I am, all that I do,
    All that I'll ever have, I offer now to You. 

    2. All that I dream, all that I pray,
    All that I'll ever make, I give to You this day. 

    3. Take and sanctify these gifts for Your honour, Lord.
    Knowing that I love and serve You is enough reward.
