<hymn title="O Lord, I Am Not Worthy" author="Burns.">
    1. O Lord, I am not worthy that Thou should’st come to me;
    But speak the words of comfort, my spirit healed shall be.

    2. And humbly I’ll receive Thee, the bridegroom of my soul,
    No more by sin to grieve Thee or fly Thy sweet control.

    3. Eternal Holy Spirit, unworthy though I be,
    Prepare me to receive Him and trust the Word to me.

    4. I offer Thee, Dear Jesus each action of today,
    My prayers, my work, my sufferings accept them now I pray.

    5. Unto Thine own, Dear Jesus, my poor heart closely bind,
    In love and reparation for sins of all mankind.

    6. Then take my gifts, Dear Jesus; take all I have to give.
    My love and heart I give Thee, within Thy heart to live.
