<hymn title="O God We Give Ourselves Today"
      author="Anthony Nye SJ, 1932-">
    1. O God we give ourselves today
    With this pure host to Thee,
    The self-same gift which Thy dear Son
    Gave once on Calvary.

    2. Entire and whole, our life and love
    With heart and soul and mind.
    For all our sins and faults and needs,
    Thy Church and all mankind.

    3. With humble and with contrite heart,
    This bread and wine we give,
    Because Thy Son once gave Himself
    And died that we might live.

    4. Though lowly now, soon by Thy word
    These offered gifts will be
    The very Body of our Lord
    His soul and deity.

    5. His very body, offered up,
    A gift beyond all price.
    He gives to us, that we may give
    In loving sacrifice.

    6. O Lord, who took our human life,
    As water mixed with wine,
    Grant through this sacrifice that we
    May share thy life divine.
